{"abstract":{"10.1.1.1.2405":"Capacity improvement is one of the principal challenges in wireless networking. We present a link-layer protocol called Slotted Seeded Channel Hopping, or SSCH, that increases the capacity of an IEEE 802.11 network by utilizing frequency diversity. SSCH can be implemented in software over an IEEE 802.11-compliant wireless card. Each node using SSCH switches across channels in such a manner that nodes desiring to communicate overlap, while disjoint communications mostly do not overlap, and hence do not interfere with each other. To achieve this, SSCH uses a novel scheme for distributed rendezvous and synchronization. Simulation results show that SSCH significantly increases network capacity in several multi-hop and single-hop wireless networking scenarios.","10.1.1.1.3504":"In this paper, we present a model for TCP/IP congestion control mechanism. The rate at which data is transmitted increases linearly in time until a packet loss is detected. At this point, the transmission rate is divided by a constant factor. Losses are generated by some exogenous random process which is assumed to be stationary ergodic. This allows us to account for any correlation and any distribution of inter-loss times. We obtain an explicit expression for the throughput of a TCP connection and bounds on the throughput when there is a limit on the window size. In addition, we study the effect of the Timeout mechanism on the throughput. A set of experiments is conducted over the real Internet and a comparison is provided with other models that make simple assumptions on the inter-loss time process. The comparison shows that our model approximates well the throughput of TCP for many distributions of inter-loss times.","10.1.1.1.4871":"In mobile ad hoc networks, nodes are dynamically changing their locations. The QoS information used for routing by traditional QoS routing protocols becomes obsolete due to node mobility. To overcome this problem, a predictive QoS routing scheme is needed. In this paper, we present a location-delay prediction scheme, based on a location-resource update protocol, which assists a QoS routing protocol. Our location updates also contain resource information pertaining to the node sending the update. This resource information for all nodes in the network and the location prediction mechanism are together used in the QoS routing decisions. Our simulation results show that, with our approach, we can predict the location at a given instant in the future with a high degree of accuracy.","10.1.1.1.5480":"The dynamic and lossy nature of wireless communication poses major challenges to reliable, self-organizing multihop networks. These non-ideal characteristics are more problematic with the primitive, low-power radio transceivers found in sensor networks, and raise new issues that routing protocols must address. Link connectivity statistics should be captured dynamically through an efficient yet adaptive link estimator and routing decisions should exploit such connectivity statistics to achieve reliability. Link status and routing information must be maintained in a neighborhood table with constant space regardless of cell density. We study and evaluate link estimator, neighborhood table management, and reliable routing protocol techniques. We focus on a many-to-one, periodic data collection workload. We narrow the design space through evaluations on large-scale, high-level simulations to 50-node, in-depth empirical experiments. The most effective solution uses a simple time averaged EWMA estimator, frequency based table management, and cost-based routing.","10.1.1.1.6902":"In this paper we present AFR, a new geometric mobile adhoc routing algorithm. The algorithm is completely distributed; nodes need to communicate only with direct neighbors in their transmission range. We show that if a best route has cost c, AFR finds a route and terminates with cost O(c    ) in the worst case. AFR is the first algorithm with cost bounded by a function of the optimal route. We also give a tight lower bound by showing that any geometric routing algorithm has worst-case    ). Thus AFR is asymptotically optimal. We give a non-geometric algorithm that also matches the lower bound, but needs some memory at each node. This establishes an intriguing trade-o# between geometry and memory.","10.1.1.10.1548":"An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of a collection of mobile nodes without the required intervention of any centralized access point or existing infrastructure. In this paper we present Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), a novel algorithm for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. Each Mobile Host operates as a specialized router, and routes are obtained as needed (i.e., on-demand) with little or no reliance on periodic advertisements. Our new routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic selfstarting network, as required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes even while repairing broken links. Because the protocol does not require global periodic routing advertisements, the demand on the overall bandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantially less than in those protocols that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we can still maintain most of the advantages of basic distance-vector routing mechanisms. We show that our algorithm scales to large populations of mobile nodes wishing to form ad-hoc networks. We also include an evaluation methodology and simulation results to verify the operation of our algorithm.","10.1.1.10.3825":"This paper studies TCP performance in a stationary multihop wireless network using IEEE 802.11  for channel access control. We first show that given a specific network topology and flow patterns, there  exists an optimal window size W # at which TCP achieves the highest throughput via maximum spatial  reuse of the shared wireless channel. However, TCP grows its window size much larger than W # , leading  to throughput reduction. We then explain the TCP throughput decrease using our observations and  analysis of the packet loss in an overloaded multihop wireless network. We find out that the network  overload is typically first signified by packet drops due to wireless link-layer contention, rather than  buffer overflow-induced losses observed in the wired Internet. As the offered load increases, the probability  of packet drops due to link contention also increases, and eventually saturates. Unfortunately,  the link-layer drop probability is insufficient to keep the TCP window size around W # . We model  and analyze the link contention behavior, based on which we propose Link RED that fine-tunes the  link-layer packet dropping probability to stabilize the TCP window size around W # . We further devise  Adaptive Pacing to better coordinate channel access along the packet forwarding path. Our simulations  demonstrate 5% to 30% improvement of TCP throughput using the proposed two techniques.","10.1.1.10.3898":"Routing of packets in a mobile ad-hoc network with a large number... this paper is a routing protocol that makes use of location information to reduce routing overhead. However, unlike other position-based routing protocols, BLR does not require nodes to periodically broadcast Hello-messages (called beaconing), and thus avoids drawbacks such as extensive use of scarce battery-power, interferences with regular data transmission, and performance degradation. BLR selects a forwarding node in a distributed manner among all its neighboring nodes with having information neither about their positions nor even about their existence. Data packets are broadcasted and the protocol takes care that just one of the receiving nodes forwards the packet. Optimized forwarding is achieved by applying a concept of Dynamic Forwarding Delay (DFD). Consequently, the node which computes the shortest forwarding delay relays the packet first. This forwarding is detected by the other nodes and suppresses them to relay the same packet any further. Analytical results and simulation experiments indicate that BLR provides efficient and robust routing in highly dynamic mobile ad-hoc networks.","10.1.1.10.4942":"TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well in traditional networks where congestion is the primary cause of packet loss. However, networks with wireless links and mobile hosts incur significant losses due to biterrors and handoff. This environment violates many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded end-toend performance. In this paper, we describe the additions and modifications to the standard Internet protocol stack (TCP/IP) to improve end-to-end reliable transport performance in mobile environments. The protocol changes are made to network-layer software at the base station and mobile host, and preserve the end-to-end semantics of TCP. One part of the modifications, called the snoop module, caches packets at the base station and performs local retransmissions across the wireless link to alleviate the problems caused by high bit-error rates. The second part is a routing protocol that enables low-latency handoff to occur with negligible data loss. We have im...","10.1.1.10.6560":"In ad hoc networks, the hidden- and the exposed-terminal problems can severely reduce the network capacity on the MAC layer. To address these problems, the ready-to-send and clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) dialogue has been proposed in the literature. However, MAC schemes using only the RTS/CTS dialogue cannot completely solve the hidden and the exposed terminal problems, as pure \"packet sensing\" MAC schemes are not safe even in fully connected networks. We propose a new MAC protocol, termed the dual busy tone multiple access (DBTMA) scheme. The operation of the DBTMA protocol is based on the RTS packet and two narrow-bandwidth, out-of-band busy tones. With the use of the RTS packet and the receive busy tone, which is set up by the receiver, our scheme completely solves the hidden- and the exposed-terminal problems. The busy tone, which is set up by the transmitter, provides protection for the RTS packets, increasing the probability of successful RTS reception and, consequently, increasing the throughput. This paper outlines the operation rules of the DBTMA scheme and analyzes its performance. Simulation results are also provided to support the analytical results. It is concluded that the DBTMA protocol is superior to other schemes that rely on the RTS/CTS dialogue on a single channel or to those that rely on a single busy tone. As a point of reference, the DBTMA scheme out-performs FAMA-NCS by 20--40% in our simulations using the network topologies borrowed from the FAMA-NCS paper. In an ad hoc network with a large coverage area, DBTMA achieves performance gain of 140% over FAMA-NCS and performance gain of 20% over RI-BTMA.","10.1.1.10.8652":"An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless computers (nodes), communicating among themselves over possibly multihop paths, without the help of any infrastructure such as base stations or access points. Although many previous ad hoc network routing protocols have been based in part on distance vector approaches, they have generally assumed a trusted environment. In this paper, we design and evaluate the Secure Efficient Ad hoc Distance vector routing protocol (SEAD), a secure ad hoc network routing protocol based on the design of the Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector routing protocol. In order to support use with nodes of limited CPU processing capability, and to guard against Denial-of-Service attacks in which an attacker attempts to cause other nodes to consume excess network bandwidth or processing time, we use efficient one-way hash functions and do not use asymmetric cryptographic operations in the protocol. SEAD performs well over the range of scenarios we tested, and is robust against multiple uncoordinated attackers creating incorrect routing state in any other node, even in spite of any active attackers or compromised nodes in the network.","10.1.1.10.9195":"Available bandwidth estimation is useful for route selection in overlay networks, QoS verification, and tra#c engineering. Recent years have seen a surge in interest in available bandwidth estimation. A few tools have been proposed and evaluated in simulation and over a limited number of Internet paths, but there is still great uncertainty in the performance of these tools over the Internet at large.","10.1.1.102.1879":"Abstract — Ad hoc networks are characterized by multihop wireless connectivity, frequently changing network topology and the need for efficient dynamic routing protocols. We compare the performance of two prominent ondemand routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks — Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV). A detailed simulation model with MAC and physical layer models is used to study interlayer interactions and their performance implications. We demonstrate that even though DSR and AODV share a similar on-demand behavior, the differences in the protocol mechanics can lead to significant performance differentials. The performance differentials are analyzed using varying network load, mobility and network size. Based on the observations, we make recommendations about how the performance of either protocol can be improved.","10.1.1.105.1024":"Abstract — Multiple access-based collision avoidance MAC protocols have typically used fixed transmission power, and have not considered power control mechanisms based on the distance of the transmitter and receiver in order to improve spatial channel reuse. This work proposes PCMA, a power controlled multiple access wireless MAC protocol within ¯ the collision avoid-ance framework. PCMA generalizes the transmit-or-defer “on/off ” collision avoidance model of current protocols to a more flexible “variable bounded power ” collision suppression model. The algorithm is provisioned for ad hoc networks and does not require the presence of base stations to manage transmission power (i.e. it is decentralized). The advantage of implementing a power controlled protocol in an ad-hoc network is that source-destination pairs can be more tightly packed into the network allowing a greater number of simultaneous transmissions (spectral reuse). Our initial simulation results show that the PCMA can improve the throughput performance of the non-power controlled IEEE 802.11 by a factor of 2 with potential for additional scalability as source destination pairs become more localized, thus providing a compelling reason for migrating to a new power controlled multiple access wireless MAC protocol standard.","10.1.1.105.3673":"A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.","10.1.1.106.2623":"Abstract—Link adaptation to dynamically select the data transmission rate at a given time has been recognized as an effective way to improve the goodput performance of the IEEE 802.11 wireless local-area networks (WLANs). Recently, with the introduction of the new high-speed 802.11a physical layer (PHY), it is even more important to have a well-designed link adaptation scheme work with the 802.11a PHY such that its fast transmission rates can be exploited. In this paper, we first present a generic method to analyze the goodput performance of an 802.11a system under the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), and express the expected effective goodput as a closed-form function of the data payload length, the frame retry count, the wireless channel condition, and the selected data transmission rate. Then, based on the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit)based link adaptation scheme for the 802.11a systems. It is a simple table-driven approach, and the basic idea is to pre-establish a best PHY mode table by applying the dynamic programming technique. The best PHY mode table is indexed by the system status triplet that consists of the data payload length, the wireless channel condition, and the frame retry count. At run-time, a wireless station determines the most appropriate PHY mode for the next transmission attempt by a simple table lookup, using the most upto-date system status as the index. Our in-depth simulation shows that the proposed MPDU-based link adaptation scheme outperforms the single-mode schemes and the AutoRate Fallback (ARF) scheme — which is used in Lucent Technologies ’ WaveLAN-II networking devices — significantly in terms of the average goodput, the frame drop rate, and the average number of transmission attempts per data frame delivery.","10.1.1.106.9714":"Abstract — Directional antennas can be useful in significantly increasing node and network lifetime in wireless ad hoc networks. In order to utilize directional antennas, an algorithm is needed that will enable nodes to point their antennas to the right place at the right time. In this paper we present an energy-efficient routing and scheduling algorithm that coordinates transmissions in ad hoc networks where each node has a single directional antenna. Using the topology consisting of all the possible links in the network, we first find shortest cost paths to be energy efficient. Then, we calculate the amount of traffic that has to go over each link and find the maximum amount of time each link can be up, using end-to-end traffic information to achieve that routing. Finally, we schedule nodes’ transmissions, trying to minimize the total time it takes for all possible transmitter-receiver pairs to communicate with each","10.1.1.108.9186":"Authentication using a path of trusted intermediaries, each able to authenticate the next in the path, is a well-known technique for authenticating entities in a large-scale system. Recent work has extended this technique to include multiple paths in an effort to bolster authentication, but the success of this approach may be unclear in the face of intersecting paths, ambiguities in the meaning of certificates, and interdependencies in the use of different keys. Thus, several authors have proposed metrics to evaluate the confidence afforded by a set of paths. In this paper we develop a set of guiding principles for the design of such metrics. We motivate our principles by showing how previous approaches failed with respect to these priniciples and what the consequences to authentication might be. We then propose a new metric that appears to meet our principles, and so to be a satisfactory metric of authentication.","10.1.1.109.7382":"Permission is granted for noncommercial reproduction of the work for educational or research purposes.","10.1.1.11.3241":"In this paper, we investigate the transmission of H.263 video sequences over wireless networks with error recovery provided by a twostep adaptive hybrid ARQ scheme using RS codes. Each video frame is divided into data packets for transmission. For each packet transmission, by using a simple table-driven approach, the best RS code is selected from a given set of codes to minimize the transmission overhead. Further, an additional adaptation step is used to guarantee certain QoS requirement. Simulation results show that the proposed error recovery scheme outperforms the traditional single-code schemes and the single-step error recovery schemes thanks to its adaptability to both the wireless channel condition and the actual frame loss events.","10.1.1.11.4819":"Most recent ad hoc network research has focused on providing routing services without considering security. In this paper, we detail security threats against ad hoc routing protocols, specifically examining AODV and DSR. In light of these threats, we identify three different environments with distinct security requirements. We propose a solution to one, the managed-open scenario where no network infrastructure is pre-deployed, but a small amount of prior security coordination is expected. Our protocol, ARAN, is based on certificates and successfully defeats all identified attacks.","10.1.1.11.5121":"In wireless sensor networks, energy efficiency is crucial to achieve satisfactory network lifetime. In order to reduce the energy consumption of a node significantly, its radio needs to be turned off. Yet, some nodes have to participate in multi-hop packet forwarding. We tackle this issue by exploiting two degrees of freedom in topology management: the path setup latency and the network density. First, we propose a new technique called Sparse Topology and Energy Management (STEM), which aggressively puts nodes to sleep. It provides a method to wake up nodes only when they need to forward data, where latency is traded off for energy savings. Second, STEM integrates efficiently with existing approaches that leverage the fact that nearby nodes can be equivalent for traffic forwarding. In this case, an increased network density results in more energy savings. We analyze a hybrid scheme, which takes advantage of both setup latency and network density to increase the nodes' lifetime. Our results show improvements of nearly two orders of magnitude compared to sensor networks without topology management.","10.1.1.11.6634":"In this article we introduce a new conception of three-dimensional DataSpace, which is physical space enhanced by connectivity to the network.","10.1.1.11.7750":"Mobile systems must adapt their behavior to changing network conditions. To do this, they must accurately estimate available network capacity. Producing quality estimates is challenging because network observations are noisy, particularly in mobile, ad hoc networks. Current systems depend on simple, exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) filters. These filters are either able to detect true changes quickly or to mask observed noise and transients, but cannot do both. In this paper, we present four filters designed to react quickly to persistent changes while tolerating transient noise. Such filters are ##### when possible, but ###### when necessary, adapting their behavior to prevailing conditions. These filters are evaluated in a variety of networking situations, including persistent and transient change, congestion, and topology changes. We find that one filter, based on techniques from ########### ####### ##### ##, provides performance superior to the other three. Compared to two EWMA filters, one agile and the other stable, it is able to offer the agility of the former in four of five scenarios and the stability of the latter in three of four scenarios.","10.1.1.11.7793":"In this paper we present two protocols for asynchronous Byzantine Quorum Systems (BQS) built on top of reliable channels---one for self-verifying data and the other for any data. Our protocols tolerate Byzantine failures with fewer servers than existing solutions by eliminating nonessential work in the write protocol and by using read and write quorums of different sizes. Since engineering a reliable network layer on an unreliable network is difficult, two other possibilities must be explored. The first is to strengthen the model by allowing synchronous networks that use time-outs to identify failed links or machines. We consider running synchronous and asynchronous Byzantine Quorum protocols over synchronous networks and conclude that, surprisingly, \"self-timing\" asynchronous Byzantine protocols may offer significant advantages for many synchronous networks when network time-outs are long. We show how to extend an existing Byzantine Quorum protocol to eliminate its dependency on reliable networking and to handle message loss and retransmission explicitly.","10.1.1.11.8053":"A mobile ad hoc network is an autonomous system of infrastructureless, multihop wireless mobile nodes. Reactive routing protocols perform well in such an environment due to their ability to cope quickly against topological changes. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol called Caching and Multipath (CHAMP) Routing Protocol. CHAMP uses cooperative packet caching and shortest multipath routing to reduce packet loss due to frequent route breakdowns. Simulation results reveal that by using a five-packet data cache, CHAMP exhibits excellent improvement in packet delivery, outperforming AODV and DSR by at most 30% in stressful scenarios. Furthermore, end-to-end delay is significantly reduced while routing overhead is lower at high mobility rates.","10.1.1.110.6935":"Networked sensors-those that coordinate amongst them-selves to achieve a larger sensing task-will revolutionize information gathering and processing both in urban envi-ronments and in inhospitable terrain. The sheer numbers of these sensors and the expected dynamics in these environ-ments present unique challenges in the design of unattended autonomous sensor networks. These challenges lead us to hypothesize that sensor network coordination applications may need to be structured differently from traditional net-work applications. In particular, we believe that localized algorithms (in which simple local node behavior achieves a desired global objective) may be necessary for sensor net-work coordination. In this paper, we describe localized al-gorithms, and then discuss directed diffusion, a simple com-munication model for describing localized algorithms. 1","10.1.1.110.8641":"Ad-hoc networks are completely wireless networks of mobile hosts, in which the topology rapidly changes due to the movement of mobile hosts. This frequent topology may lead to sudden packet losses and delays. Transport protocols like TCP have been built mainly for reliable, xed networks. Hence, when used in adhoc networks, TCP misinterprets this loss as congestion and invokes congestion control. This leads to unnecessary retransmissions and loss of throughput. To overcome this problem, a feedback scheme is proposed, so that the source can distinguish between route failure and network congestion. When a route is disrupted, the source is sent a Route Failure Noti cation(RFN) packet, allowing it to freeze its timers and stop sending packets. When the route is re-established, the source is informed through a Route Re-establishment Noti-cation (RRN) packet, upon which it resumes by unfreezing timers and continuing packet transmissions. The simulated performance of TCP on ad-hoc networks with and without feedback is compared and reported. It is observed that in the event of route failures, as the route re-establishment time increases, the use of feedback provides signi cant gains in throughput as well as savings in unnecessary packet transmissions. Several further enhancements and directions for future work are also sketched. 1","10.1.1.110.9916":"Click is a new software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers.

Routing based on a connected dominating set is a promising approach, where the searching space for a route is reduced to nodes in the set. A set is dominating if all the nodes in the system are either in the set or neighbors of nodes in the set. Wu and Li [1] proposed a simple and efficient distributed algorithm for calculating connected dominating set in ad hoc wireless networks, where connections of nodes are determined by geographical distances of nodes. In general, nodes in the connected dominating set consume more energy in order to handle various bypass traffics than nodes outside the set. To prolong the life span of each node, and hence, the network by balancing the energy consumption in the network, nodes should be alternated in being chosen to form a connected dominating set. In this paper, we propose a method of calculating power-aware connected dominating set. Our simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms several existing approaches in terms of life span of the network.

GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions us-ing only information about a router's immediate neighbors in the network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around the perimeter of the region. By keeping state only about the local topology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-path and ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinations increases. Under mobility's frequent topology changes, GPSR can use local topology information to find correct new routes quickly. We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation of mobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that of Dynamic Source Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR's scalability on densely deployed wireless networks.","10.1.1.112.2848":"Routing protocols for wireless ad hoc networks have traditionally focused on finding paths with minimum hop count. However, such paths can include slow or lossy links, leading to poor throughput. A routing algorithm can select better paths by explicitly taking the quality of the wireless links into account. In this paper, we conduct a detailed, empirical evaluation of the performance of three link-quality metrics— ETX, per-hop RTT, and per-hop packet pair—and compare them against minimum hop count. We study these metrics using a DSR-based routing protocol running in a wireless testbed. We find that the ETX metric has the best performance when all nodes are stationary. We also find that the per-hop RTT and per-hop packet-pair metrics perform poorly due to self-interference. Interestingly, the hop-count metric outperforms all of the link-quality metrics in a scenario where the sender is mobile.","10.1.1.112.3914":"Wireless distributed microsensor systems will enable the reliable monitoring of a variety of environments for both civil and military applications. In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multihop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated. 1.","10.1.1.112.4293":"Abstract — We consider the design of channel codes for improving the data rate and/or the reliability of communications over fading channels using multiple transmit antennas. Data is encoded by a channel code and the encoded data is split into � streams that are simultaneously transmitted using � transmit antennas. The received signal at each receive antenna is a linear superposition of the � transmitted signals perturbed by noise. We derive performance criteria for designing such codes under the assumption that the fading is slow and frequency nonselective. Performance is shown to be determined by matrices constructed from pairs of distinct code sequences. The minimum rank among these matrices quantifies the diversity gain, while the minimum determinant of these matrices quantifies the coding gain. The results are then extended to fast fading channels. The design criteria are used to design trellis codes for high data rate wireless communication. The encoding/decoding complexity of these codes is comparable to trellis codes employed in practice over Gaussian channels. The codes constructed here provide the best tradeoff between data rate, diversity advantage, and trellis complexity. Simulation results are provided for 4 and 8 PSK signal sets with data rates of 2 and 3 bits/symbol, demonstrating excellent performance that is within 2–3 dB of the outage capacity for these channels using only 64 state encoders.","10.1.1.113.2393":"Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned to perform well in traditional networks where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. However, networks with wireless and other lossy links also suffer from significant losses due to bit errors and handoffs. TCP responds to all losses by invoking congestion control and avoidance algorithms, resulting in degraded end-to-end performance in wireless and lossy systems. In this paper, we compare several schemes designed to improve the performance of TCP in such networks. We classify these schemes into three broad categories: end-to-end protocols, where loss recovery is performed by the sender; link-layer protocols, that provide local reliability; and split-connection protocols, that break the end-to-end connection into two parts at the base station. We present the results of several experiments performed in both LAN and WAN environments, using throughput and goodput as the metrics for comparison. Our results show that a reliable link-layer protocol that is TCP-aware provides very good performance. Furthermore, it is possible to achieve good performance without splitting the end-to-end connection at the base station. We also demonstrate that selective acknowledgments and explicit loss notifications result in significant performance improvements. 1.","10.1.1.113.4100":"Abstract — As mobile ad hoc network applications are deployed, security emerges as a central requirement. In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication.

This paper is motivated by the need for fundamental understanding of ultimate limits of bandwidth efficient delivery of higher bit-rates in digital wireless communications and to also begin to look into how these limits might be approached. We examine exploitation of multi-element array (MEA) technology, that is processing the spatial dimension (not just the time dimension) to improve wireless capacities in certain applications. Specifically, we present some basic information theory results that promise great advantages of using MEAs in wireless LANs and building to building wireless communication links. We explore the important case when the channel characteristic is not available at the transmitter but the receiver knows (tracks) the characteristic which is subject to Rayleigh fading. Fixing the overall transmitted power, we express the capacity offered by MEA technology and we see how the capacity scales with increasing SNR for a large but practical number, n, of antenna elements at both transmitter and receiver. We investigate the case of independent Rayleigh faded paths between antenna elements and find that with high probability extraordinary capacity is available. Compared to the baseline n = 1 case, which by Shannon’s classical formula scales as one more bit/cycle for every 3 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increase, remarkably with MEAs, the scaling is almost like n more bits/cycle for each 3 dB increase in SNR. To illustrate how great this capacity is, even for small n, take the cases n = 2, 4 and 16 at an average received SNR of 21 dB.

To achieve this, we have proposed an adaptive MAC protocol, where each node keeps certain neighborhood information dynamically so that each node can avoid interference by keeping track of other communicating nodes at that instant of time. Moreover, appropriate mechanism for null steering of directional antennas in user terminals can help exchanging the neighborhood information in presence of on-going communication and can drastically improve the medium utilization through overlapping communications in different directions. Subsequently, we have proposed a modified link-state based table-driven routing protocol that captures the approximate network status periodically without generating lot of control traffic. It uses the directional capability of adaptive antenna for capturing, disseminating and using the network information for directional routing.","10.1.1.117.1253":"Advances in processor, memory and radio technology will enable small and cheap nodes capable of sensing, communication and computation. Networks of such nodes can coordinate to perform distributed sensing of environmental phenomena. In this paper, we explore the directed diffusion paradigm for such coordination. Directed diffusion is data-centric in that all communication is for named data. All nodes in a directed diffusion-based network are application-aware. This enables diffusion to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically good paths and by caching and processing data in-network. We explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a simple remote-surveillance sensor network.","10.1.1.117.6416":"Early simulation experience with wireless ad hoc networks suggests that their capacity can be surprisingly low, due to the requirement that nodes forward each others’ packets. The achievable capacity depends on network size, traffic patterns, and detailed local radio interactions. This paper examines these factors alone and in combination, using simulation and analysis from first principles. Our results include both specific constants and general scaling relationships helpful in understanding the limitations of wireless ad hoc networks. We examine interactions of the 802.11 MAC and ad hoc forwarding and the effect on capacity for several simple configurations and traffic patterns. While 802.11 discovers reasonably good schedules, we nonetheless observe capacities markedly less than optimal for very simple chain and lattice networks with very regular traffic patterns. We validate some simulation results with experiments. We also show that the traffic pattern determines whether an ad hoc network’s per node capacity will scale to large networks. In particular, we show that for total capacity to scale up with network size the average distance between source and destination nodes must remain small as the network grows. Non-local traffic patterns in which this average distance grows with the network size result in a rapid decrease of per node capacity. Thus the question “Are large ad hoc networks feasible?” reduces to a question about the likely locality of communication in such networks.","10.1.1.12.1241":"This study examines the random waypoint model widely used in the simulation studies of mobile ad hoc networks.

In particular, certain ad hoc routing metrics can drop by as much as 40% over the course of a 900-second simulation using the random waypoint model. We give both an intuitive and a formal explanation for this phenomenon. We also propose a simple fix of the problem and discuss a few alternatives.

One goal of this paper is to evaluate various LDAs under different wireless network topologies and competing traffic. A second goal of this paper is to propose and evaluate a new LDA, called ZigZag, as well as a class of hybrid algorithms based upon ZigZag. We then evaluate these LDAs via simulation. Based upon our simulation results, we find that no single base algorithm performs well across all topologies and competition. However, the hybrid algorithms perform well across topologies, competition, and in some cases match or exceed the performance of the best base LDA for a given scenario.","10.1.1.12.5035":"We consider dynamic routing and power allocation for a wireless network with time varying channels. The network consists of power constrained nodes which transmit over wireless links with adaptive transmission rates. Packets randomly enter the system at each node and wait in output queues to be transmitted through the network to their destinations. We establish the capacity region of all rate matrices (# ij ) that the system can stably support---where (# ij ) represents the rate of traffic originating at node i and destined for node j. A joint routing and power allocation policy is developed which stabilizes the system and provides bounded average delay guarantees whenever the input rates are within this capacity region. Such performance holds for general arrival and channel state processes, even if these processes are unknown to the network controller. We then apply this control algorithm to an ad-hoc wireless network where channel variations are due to user mobility, and compare its performance with the Grossglauser-Tse relay model developed in [13].","10.1.1.12.5408":"We propose a new approach to securing self-organized mobile ad hoc networks.

We show that the small-world phenomenon naturally emerges in the PGP system as a consequence of the self-organization of users. We show this by studying the PGP certificate graph properties and by quantifying its small-world characteristics. We argue that the certificate graphs of self-organized security systems will exhibit a similar small-world phenomenon, and we provide a way to model self-organized certificate graphs.

It has been observed that in ad hoc networks, energy consumption does not reflect the communication activities in the network. Many existing energy conservation protocols based on electing a routing backbone for global connectivity are oblivious to traffic characteristics. In this paper, we propose an extensible on-demand power management framework for ad hoc networks that adapts to traffic load. Nodes maintain soft-state timers that determine power management transitions. By monitoring routing control messages and data transmission, these timers are set and refreshed on-demand. Nodes that are not involved in data delivery may go to sleep as supported by the MAC protocol. This soft state is aggregated across multiple flows and its maintenance requires no additional out-of-band messages. We implement a prototype of our framework in the ns-2 simulator that uses the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. Simulation studies using our scheme with the Dynamic Source Routing protocol show a reduction in energy consumption near 50% when compared to a network without power management under both long-lived CBR traffic and on-off traffic loads, with comparable throughput and latency. Preliminary results also show that it outperforms existing routing backbone election approaches.","10.1.1.12.9698":"Abstract---This paper considers resource allocation and pricing for the downlink of a wireless network. We describe a model that applies to either a time-slotted system (e.g. Qualcomm's HDR proposal) or a CDMA system; the main feature of this model is that the channel quality varies across the users. We study using a pricing scheme for the allocation of radio resources. We show that to maximize revenue in such a system, the base station should allocate resources in a discriminatory manner, where different users are charged different prices based in part on their channel quality. However optimally allocating resources in this way is shown to require knowledge about each user's utility function. We consider a suboptimal scheme which does not require knowledge of the users ' utility functions, and show that this scheme is asymptotically optimal, in the limit of large demand. Moreover such a scheme is shown to maximize social welfare. We also consider a heuristic scheme for the case of small demand, which does not require perfect knowledge about the users ' utility functions.

IP-based transport protocols thus suffer from poor performance when a mobile host communicates with a host on the fixed network. This is caused by frequent disruptions in network layer connectivity due to — i) mobility and ii) unreliable nature of the wireless link. We describe the design and implementation of I-TCP, which is an indirect transport layer protocol for mobile hosts. I-TCP utilizes the resources of Mobility Support Routers (MSRs) to provide transport layer communication between mobile hosts and hosts on the fixed network. With I-TCP, the problems related to mobility and the unreliability of wireless link are handled entirely within the wireless link; the TCP/IP software on the fixed hosts is not modified. Using I-TCP on our testbed, the throughput between a fixed host and a mobile host improved substantially in comparison to regular TCP. 1","10.1.1.125.5750":"This paper outlines our experience with the implementation and deployment of two MANET routing protocols on a five node, four hop, network. The work was prompted by the lack of published results concerning the issues associated with the implementation of MANET routing protocols on actual wireless networks, as opposed to results of simulation experiments. We examined implementations of two distance vector MANET routing protocols and found a number of problems with both protocols during the course of our experiments. The most significant was that neither protocol could provide a stable route over any multi-hop network connection. The route discovery process of both protocols is fooled by the transient availability of network links to nodes that were more than one hop away. Packets transmitted over a fading channel cause the routing protocol to conclude incorrectly that there is a new one hop neighbor that could provide a lower metric (hop count) route to even more distant nodes. This can occur even when nodes are stationary, mobility resulted in even less route stability. We implemented a simple signal strength based neighbor selection procedure to test our assertion that fading channels and unreliable network links were the cause of the failure of the routing protocols. The result was that neighbor discovery and the filtering for neighbors with which nodes could communicate reliably enables the creation of reliable multihop routes. Based on our experiences, we outline several recommendations for future work in MANET research. 1.","10.1.1.125.7013":"In an ad hoc network, the use of source routing has many advantages, including simplicity, correctness, and flexibility. For example, all routing decisions for a packet are made by the sender of the packet, avoiding the need for up-to-date routing information at intermediate nodes and allowing the routes used to be trivially guaranteed loopfree. It is also possible for the sender to use different routes for different packets, without requiring coordination or explicit support by the intermediate nodes. In addition, on-demand source routing has performed very strongly when compared against other proposed protocol designs. However, source routing has the disadvantage of increased per-packet overhead due to the source route header that must be present in every packet originated or forwarded. In this paper, we propose and analyze the use in ad hoc networks of implicit source routing, and show that it preserves the advantages of source routing while avoiding the associated per-packet overhead in most cases. We evaluated this technique through detailed simulations of ad hoc networks based on the Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR), an on-demand ad hoc network routing protocol based on source routing. Although routing packet overhead increased slightly with implicit source routing, by about 12.3%, the total number of bytes of overhead decreased substantially, by between 44 and 86%. On all other metrics evaluated, the performance of DSR either did not change significantly or actually improved somewhat, due to indirect effects of the reduced routing overhead. 1.","10.1.1.125.711":"Abstract — There are a number of scenarios where it is desirable to have a wireless device connect to multiple networks simultaneously. Currently, this is possible only by using multiple wireless network cards in the device. Unfortunately, using multiple wireless cards causes excessive energy drain and consequent reduction of lifetime in battery operated devices. In this paper, we propose a software based approach, called MultiNet, that facilitates simultaneous connections to multiple networks by virtualizing a single wireless card. The wireless card is virtualized by introducing an intermediate layer below IP, which continuously switches the card across multiple networks. The goal of the switching algorithm is to be transparent to the user who sees her machine as being connected to multiple networks. We present the design, implementation, and performance of the MultiNet system. We analyze and evaluate buffering and switching algorithms in terms of delay and energy consumption. Our system has been operational for over twelve months, it is agnostic of the upper layer protocols, and works well over popular IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN cards.

In such an environment, it may be necessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of other hosts in forwarding a packet to its destination, due to the limited range of each mobile host’s wireless transmissions. This paper presents a protocol for routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. The protocol adapts quickly to routing changes when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or no overhead during periods in which hosts move less frequently. Based on results from a packet-level simulation of mobile hosts operating in an ad hoc network, the protocol performs well over a variety of environmental conditions such as host density and movement rates. For all but the highest rates of host movement simulated, the overhead of the protocol is quite low, falling to just 1 % of total data packets transmitted for moderate movement rates in a network of 24 mobile hosts. In all cases, the difference in length between the routes used and the optimal route lengths is negligible, and in most cases, route lengths are on average within a factor of 1.01 of optimal. 1.","10.1.1.13.1261":"An ad hoc wireless network is an autonomous self- organizing system of mobile nodes connected by wireless links where nodes not in direct range communicate via intermediate nodes.

TCP-Real controls congestion as standard TCP does. However, its receiver-oriented nature and its “wave” communication pattern allow for two amending mechanisms: (i) Congestion avoidance, which reduces unnecessary transmission gaps that hurt the performance of time-constrained applications, and (ii) Advanced error detection and classification, which designates recovery tactics responsive to the nature of the errors, thereby enhancing the protocol performance over wireless links or asymmetric paths. We detail the protocol mechanisms and specification and we report extensively on the comparative fairness and efficiency evaluation of standard TCP, TCP-Real, and TCP-friendly protocols for both delay-tolerant and-sensitive applications and in both wired and wireless networks.","10.1.1.131.781":"Much progress has been made toward solving the problem of routing packets inside an ad hoc network, but there are presently no complete proposals for connecting ad hoc networks together to form larger networks, or for integrating them with wired internets.

Using this technique, we can both integrate ad hoc networks into the hierarchical Internet and support the migration of mobile nodes from the Internet into and out of ad hoc networks via Mobile IP. Taken together, these solutions improve the scalability of flat ad hoc networks by introducing hierarchy, and they enable all nodes participating in the ad hoc network to be reachable from anywhere in the world.

Factors like the lack of infrastructure, node mobility, and random radio link quality can contribute to significantly higher error rates in these networks. In addition, errors have a more serious impact on the network’s resources, due to limitations in bandwidth and battery power inherent to the wireless ad hoc environment. This further complicates the task of designing scalable routing protocols, since larger networks are likely to experience even more errors, which may lead to slower convergence, longer end-to-end delay and unnacceptably high number of retransmissions. In this paper, we focus on the impact of error prevention and recovery on the scaling properties of on-demand protocols for ad hoc networks. Our analytical study, based on the evaluation of the Witness Aided Routing (WAR) and the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols, shows that the lack of localized intervention in handling errors translates eventually into lack of scalability, both in terms of performance and resource consumption. As route length increases, the performance of DSR degrades dramatically, especially in the presence of fluctuating wireless link quality. Even for small routes, DSR’s lack of an error handling mechanism leads to very low probability of success when there is a non-zero probability that links are not bidirectional.

The manner in which nodes power themselves off does not influence the delay or throughput characteristics of our protocol. We illustrate the power conserving behavior of PAMAS via extensive simulations performed over ad hoc networks containing 10-20 nodes.

The main paradigm is that only the servers in a complete quorum can collectively grant (or revoke) access permission. The method we suggest ensures that, after authorization is revoked, a cheating user Alice will not be able to access the data even if many access servers still consider her authorized and even if the complete raw database is available to her. The method has a low overhead in terms of communication and computation. It can also be converted into a distributed system for issuing secure signatures.

To overcome this problem, a feedback scheme is proposed so that the source can distinguish between a route failure and network congestion. When a route is disrupted, the source is sent a Route Failure Notification packet, allowing it to invalidate its timers and stop sending packets. When the route is reestablished, the source is informed through a Route Reestablishment Notification packet, upon which it resumes packet transmissions. Simulation experiments show that in the event of route failures, as the route reestablishment time increases, the use of feedback provides significant improvements in performance.","10.1.1.138.3623":"Abstract—When identical randomly located nodes, each capable of transmitting at bits per second and using a fixed range, form a wireless network, the throughput @ A obtainable by each node for a randomly chosen destination is 2 bits per second under a noninterference protocol. If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission’s range is optimally chosen, the bit–distance product that can be transported by the network per second is 2 @ A bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only 2 bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers. Since the throughput furnished to each user diminishes to zero as the number of users is increased, perhaps networks connecting smaller numbers of users, or featuring connections mostly with nearby neighbors, may be more likely to be find acceptance.

In general, a realtime location tracking scheme may require complex control schemes and incur unacceptably high computation and messaging cost. Our proposed approach, namely  velocity paging scheme, relaxes the realtime constraints to semirealtime to provide a good combination of cost reduction and ease of implementation. The proposed velocity paging scheme utilizes semi-realtime velocity information, namely velocity classes, of individual mobile terminal and dynamically generates a paging zone (a list of cells to be paged) for it. Therefore, the total paging cost can be reduced due to the paging area reduction. Much consideration also has been given to reduce the complexity for the proposed scheme.

Wireless wide-area networks (WWANs) are characterized by very low and variable bandwidths, very high and variable delays, significant non-congestion related losses, asymmetric uplink and downlink channels, and occasional blackouts. Additionally, the majority of the latency in a WWAN connection is incurred over the wireless link. Under such operating conditions, most contemporary wireless TCP algorithms do not perform very well. In this paper, we present WTCP, a reliable transport protocol that addresses rate control and reliability over commercial WWAN networks such as CDPD. WTCP is rate-based, uses only end-to-end mechanisms, performs rate control at the receiver, and uses inter-packet delays as the primary metric for rate control. We have implemented and evaluated WTCP over the CDPD network, and also simulated it in the ns-2 simulator. Our results indicate that WTCP can improve on the performance of comparable algorithms such as TCP-NewReno, TCP-Vegas, and Snoop-TCP by between 20 % to 200 % for typical operating conditions.","10.1.1.154.9133":"Abstract-End-to-end congestion control mechanisms have been critical to the robustness and stability of the Internet. Most of today’s Internet trafftc is TCP, and we expect this to remain so in the future. Thus, having “TCP-friendly ” behavior is crucial for new applications. However, the emergence of non-congestion-controlled realtime applications threatens unfairness to competing TCP traffic and possible congestion collapse. We present an end-to-end TCP-friendly Rate Adaptation Protocol (RAP), which employs an additive-increase, multiplicativedecrease (AIMD) algorithm. It is well suited for unicast playback of realtime streams and other semi-reliable rate-based applications. Its primary goal is to be fair and TCP-friendly while separating network congestion control from application-level reliability. We evaluate RAP through extensive simulation, and conclude that bandwidth is usually evenly shared between TCP and RAP traffic. Unfairness to TCP traffic is directly determined by how TCP diverges from the AIMD algorithm. Basic RAP behaves in a TCPfriendly fashion in a wide range of likely conditions, but we also devised a fine-grain rate adaptation mechanism to extend this range further. Finally, we show that deploying RED queue management can result in an ideal fairness between TCP and RAP traffic.

We present an approach to this problem based on instance based learning (IBL) techniques. To cast the anomaly detection task in an IBL framework, we employ an approach that transforms temporal sequences of discrete, unordered observations into a metric space via a similarity measure that encodes intra-attribute dependencies. Classification boundaries are selected from an a posteriori characterization of the valid user's behaviors, coupled with a domain heuristic. An empirical evaluation of the approach on user command data demonstrates that we can accurately differentiate the profiled user from alternative users when the available features encode sufficient information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system detects anomalous conditions quickly -- an important quality for reducing potential damage by a malicious user. We present several techniques for reducing the data storage requirements of the user profile, including instance selection methods and clustering. An empirical evaluation shows that a new greedy clustering algorithm reduces the size of the user model by 70 % with only a small loss in accuracy. A comparison of the greedy clustering technique to clustering with K-centers shows that greedy clustering is preferable in terms of accuracy and computation time for this domain.","10.1.1.16.1535":"This paper proposes S-MAC, a medium-access control (MAC) protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with individual nodes remaining largely inactive for long periods of time, but then becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in almost every way: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses three novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. To reduce energy consumption in listening to an idle channel, nodes periodically sleep. Neighboring nodes form virtual clusters to auto-synchronize on sleep schedules. Inspired by PAMAS, S-MAC also sets the radio to sleep during transmissions of other nodes. Unlike PAMAS, it only uses in-channel signaling. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for sensor-network applications that require store-andforward processing as data move through the network. We evaluate our implementation of S-MAC over a sample sensor node, the Mote, developed at University of California, Berkeley. The experiment results show that, on a source node, an 802.11-like MAC consumes 2--6 times more energy than S-MAC for traffic load with messages sent every 1--10s.","10.1.1.16.3133":"We investigate the scalability of feedback in multicast communication and propose a new method of probabilistic feedback based on exponentially distributed timers.

The mechanism is robust against the loss of feedback messages and works well in case of homogeneous and heterogeneous delays. We apply the feedback mechanism to reliable multicast and compare it to existing timerbased feedback schemes. Our mechanism achieves lower NAK latency for the same performance in terms of NAK suppression. No topological information of the network is used and data delivery is the only support required from the network. The mechanism adapts to a dynamic number of receivers and leads to a stable performance for implosion avoidance and feedback latency.","10.1.1.16.3935":"We consider a large-scale wireless network, but with a low density of nodes per unit area.

These equivalent formulations provide efficient computational procedures for the solution of our model. Furthermore, with the help of the fixed point formulation we are able to prove the existence of a solution. Our model has the main advantage of not requiring the pre-definition of bottleneck links. The model also takes into account the receiver congestion window limitation. Our approach can be used for TCP/IP networks with drop tail buggers as well as for TCP/IP networks with active queue management buggers. We solve the problem for some network examples and we show how the distribution of load varies with network parameters. The distribution of load is sometimes counter-intuitive which cannot be detected by other models making prior assumptions on the locations of bottlenecks.","10.1.1.16.730":"We introduce a novel technique for computation of consecutive preimages of hash chains.

In this paper, we consider essentially the same physical model of a wireless network under a different traffic pattern, namely the relay traffic pattern, but we allow for arbitrarily complex network coding. In our model, there is only one active source/destination pair, while all other nodes assist this transmission. We show code constructions leading to achievable rates and derive upper bounds from the max-flow min-cut theorem. It is shown that lower and upper bounds meet asymptotically as the number of nodes in the network goes to infinity, thus proving that the capacity of the wireless network with n nodes under the relay traffic pattern behaves like log n bits per second. This demonstrates also that network coding is essential: under the point-topoint coding assumption considered in [1], the achievable rate is constant, independent of the number of nodes.","10.1.1.16.9391":"For wireless cellular and ad hoc networks with QoS constraints, we propose a suite of problem formulations that allocate network resources to optimize SIR, maximize throughput and minimize delay.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of combining the concept of power control with the RTS/CTS-based and busy-tone-based protocols to further increase channel utilization. A sender will use an appropriate power level to transmit its packets so as to increase the possibility of channel reuse. The possibility of using discrete, instead of continuous, power levels is also discussed. Through analyses and simulations, we demonstrate the advantage of our new MAC protocol.

State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule-based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the State Transition Analysis Tool (STAT).

Mobility management in a terminode network may be performed by a combination of the following functions. Firstly, a location tracking algorithm is assumed to exist between communicating terminodes; this allows a terminode to predict the location (LDA) of corresponding terminodes. Secondly, LDA management, which is based on the distributed location database, allows a terminode A to obtain a probable location of terminode B (LDAB ) that A is not tracking by the previous method.

Given a set of wireless network nodes, the directed weighted transmission graph Gt has an edge uv if and only if node v is in the transmission range of node u and the weight of uv is typically defined as II,,vll + c for a constant 2 <_ t ~ < 5 and c> O. The minimum power topology Gm is the smallest subgraph of Gt that contains the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, i.e., the union of all shortest paths. In this paper, we described a distributed position-based networking protocol to construct an enclosure graph G~, which is an approximation of Gin. The time complexity of each node u is O(min(dG ~ (u)dG ~ (u), dG ~ (u) log dG ~ (u))), where dc(u) is the degree of node u in a graph G. The space required at each node to compute the minimum power topology is O(dG ~ (u)). This improves the previous result that computes Gm in O(dG, (u) a) time using O(dGt(U) 2) spaces. We also show that the average degree dG,(u) is usually a constant, which is at most 6. Our result is first developed for stationary network and then extended to mobile networks.

By using location information, the proposed Location-Aided Routing (LAR) protocols limit the search for a new route to a smaller “request zone ” of the ad hoc network.

Traditional striping algorithms suffer from two major disadvantages. They provide inadequateload sharing in the presence of variable length packets, and may result in non-FIFOdelivery of data. We describe a new family of link striping algorithms that solves both problems. Our scheme applies to any layer that can provide multiple FIFO channels. We deal with variable sized packets by showing how fair queuing algorithms can be transformed into load sharing algorithms. Our transformation results in practical load sharing protocols, and shows a theoretical connection between two seemingly different problems. The same transformation can be applied to obtain load sharing protocols for links with different capacities. We deal with the FIFO requirement for two separate cases. If a sequencenumber can be added to each packet, we show how to speed up packet processing by letting the receiver simulate the sender algorithm. If no header can be added, we show how to provide quasi-FIFO delivery. Quasi-FIFO is FIFO except during occasional periods of loss of synchronization. We argue that quasi-FIFOis adequatefor most applications. We also describe a simple technique for speedy restoration of synchronization in the event of loss. We develop an architectural framework for transparently embedding our protocol at the network level by striping IP packetsacross multiple physical interfaces. The resulting strIPe protocol has been implemented within the NetBSD kernel. Our measurementsand simulations showthat the protocol offers scalable throughputeven when striping is done over dissimilar links, and that the protocol synchronizes quickly after packet loss. Measurements show performance improvements over conventional round robin striping schemes and striping schemes that do not resequence packets. 1","10.1.1.2.1314":"One role for workload generation is as a means for understanding how servers and networks respond to variation in load.

The first solution is called the mobile PNNI scheme because it builds on the PNNI routing protocol. It uses limitedscope (characterized by a parameter  S)  reachability updates, forwarding pointers, and a route optimization procedure. The second solution is called the LR (location registers) scheme because it introduces location registers (such as the cellular home and visitor location registers) into the PNNI standards-based hierarchical networks. This scheme uses a hierarchical arrangement of location registers with the hierarchy limited to a certain level S. Analytical models are set up to compare the average move, search, and total costs per move of these two schemes for different values of the CMR (call-to-mobility ratio), and to provide guidelines for selecting parameters of the algorithms. Results show that at low CMR's (CMR !0.025), the LR scheme performs better than the mobile PNNI scheme. We also observe that the two schemes show a contrasting behavior in terms of the value to be used for the parameter S to achieve the least average total cost. At low CMR's, the parameter S should be high for the mobile PNNI scheme, but low for the LR scheme, and vice versa for high CMR's.  Index Terms---Mobility management, PNNI, wireless ATM.

To realize this expectation, a diverse set of challenges need to be addressed, which are posed by heterogeneous wireless networking environments within NGWI and the according application requirements. Furthermore, the architectural heterogeneities must be captured dynamically, while mobile users may roam during their connection duration. Current existing transport layer protocols have been developed for a specific network paradigm in mind, e.g., for wireless local area networks (WLANs), micro/macro wireless systems, or for satellite systems. Using these existing different transport layer protocols for NGWI to support global roaming of mobile users is not a practical solution due to processing and memory constraints of wireless terminals. Thus, there is a need","10.1.1.221.2058":"... Each mobile terminal communicates with the wireline network through a nearby base station. In order to route incoming calls to a destination mobile terminal, the network must keep track of the location of each mobile terminal from time to time. This is achieved by location update such that each mobile terminal reports its current location to the network at specific time points. When an incoming call arrives, the network will page the mobile terminal starting from the last updated location. A trade-off, therefore, exists between the frequency of location update and the number of locations paged in order to track down the mobile terminal. This paper introduces a location update policy which minimizes the cost of mobile terminal location tracking. A mobile terminal dynamically determines when to update after moving to a new cell based on its mobility pattern and the incoming call arrival probability. The performance of this scheme is close to that of the optimal policy reported earlier. However, the processing time requirement of this scheme is very low. The minimal computation required by this scheme enables its usage in mobile terminals which has limited energy supply and computational power.","10.1.1.221.2247":"This paper describes the concept of sensor networks which has been made viable by the convergence of microelectro-mechanical systems technology, wireless communications and digital electronics.

Movement-based location update is selected for its simplicity. It does not require ea & mobile terminal to store information about the arrangement and the distance relationship of all cells. In fact, each mobile terminal only keeps a counter of the number of cells visited. A location update is performed when this counter exceeds a predefined threshold value. This scheme allows the dynamic selection of the movement threshold on a per-user basis. This is desirable as different users may have very different mobility patterns. Selective paging reduces the cost for locating a mobile terminal in the expense of an increase in the paging delay. In this paper, we propose a selective paging scheme which significantly decreases the location tracking cost under a small increase in the allowable paging delay. We introduce an analytical model for the proposed location tracking mechanism which captures the mobility and the incoming call arrival patterns of each mobile terminal. Analytical results are provided to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed scheme under various parameters.

Every node only has to know its 2-hop neighbors to find the edges in this new structure. Our method applies the Yao structure on the local Delaunay graph [21] in an ordering that are computed locally. This new structure has the following attractive properties: (1) it is a planar graph; (2) its node degree is bounded from above by a positive constant 19 + ⌈ 2π α ⌉; (3) it is a t-spanner (given any two nodes u and v, there is a path connecting them in the structure such that its length is no more than t ≤ max { π α,πsin 2 2 +1}·Cdel times of the shortest path in UDG); (4) it can be constructed locally and is easy to maintain when the nodes move around; (5) moreover, we show that the total communication cost is O(n), where n is the number of wireless nodes, and the computation cost of each node is at most O(d log d), where d is its 2-hop neighbors in the original unit disk graph. Here Cdel is the spanning ratio of the Delaunay triangulation, which is at most 4 √ 3 9 π. And the adjustable parameter α satisfies 0 <α<π/3. In addition, experiments are conducted to show this topology is efficient in practice, compared with other well-known topologies used in wireless ad hoc networks. Previously, only centralized method [5] of constructing bounded degree planar spanner is known, with degree bound 27 and spanning ratio t ≃ 10.02.

PARO is applicable to a number of networking environments including sensor networks, home networks and mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper, we present the detailed design of PARO and evaluate the protocol using simulation and experimentation. We show through simulation that PARO is capable of outperforming traditional broadcast-based routing protocols (e.g., MANET routing protocols) due to its power conserving point-to-point on-demand design.

Specifically, we attempt to develop a basic understanding, using analysis and simulation, of the properties of TCP/IP in a regime where (1) the bandwidth-delay product of the network is high compared to the buffering in the network, and (2) there may be transient congestion due to fluctuations in real-time traffic, modeled here as producing random losses among the packets of the TCP connection of interest. The following key results are obtained. First, random loss leads to significant throughput deterioration when the product of the loss probability and the square of the bandwidth-delay product is larger than one. Unless network resources are specifically reserved for data traffic, data traffic will inevitably incur random losses due to transient fluctuations in higher priority real-time traffic when the network is highly utilized. Second, for multiple connections sharing a bottleneck link, TCP is grossly unfair towards connections with higher round-trip delays. This means that a simple First In First Out (FIFO) queueing discipline might not suffice for data traffic in WANs. Finally, we observe that, while the recent Reno version of TCP produces less bursty traffic than the original Tahoe version, it is less robust than the latter when successive losses are closely spaced. We conclude by indicating modifications that may be required both at the transport and network layers to provide good end-to-end performance over high-speed WANs.","10.1.1.24.1517":"1  Currently two projects are on their way to standardize physical layer and medium access control for wireless LANs - IEEE 802.11 and ETSI RES10 Hiperlan.

Since direct communication is allowed only between adjacent nodes, distant nodes communicate over multiple hops. The quality-ofservice (QoS) routing in an ad-hoc network is difficult because the network topology may change constantly and the available state information for routing is inherently imprecise. In this paper, we propose a distributed QoS routing scheme which selects a network path with sucient resources to satisfy certain delay (or bandwidth) requirement in a dynamic multi-hop mobile environment. The proposed algorithms work with imprecise state information. Multiple paths are searched in parallel to find the best qualified one. Fault-tolerance techniques are brought in for the maintenance of the routing paths when the nodes move, join, or leave the network. Our algorithms consider not only the QoS requirement but also the cost optimality of the routing path in order to improve the overall network performance. Extensive simulations show that high call-admission ratio and low-cost paths are achieved with modest routing overhead.

Though on-demand routing approaches have been shown to perform well, they generally lack the support for Quality-of-Service (QoS) with respect to data transmission. In order to select a subset of endto -end paths to provide increased stability and reliability of routes, a new QoS metric, end-to-end reliability, is defined and emphasized in this paper. We present a distributed multi-path dynamic source routing protocol (MP-DSR) for wireless ad-hoc networks to improve QoS support with respect to end-to-end reliability. Our protocol forwards outgoing packets along multiple paths that are subject to a particular end-to-end reliability requirement. A simulation study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed protocol, particularly the fact that MP-DSR achieves a higher rate of successful packet delivery than existing best-effort ad-hoc routing protocols, such as the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR).","10.1.1.25.2774":"We present an overview of ad-hoc routing protocols that make forwarding decisions based on the geographical position of a packet's destination.

This is a major advantage in a mobile ad-hoc network where the topology may change frequently. The main prerequisite for position-based routing is that a sender can obtain the current position of the destination. Therefore, recently proposed location services are discussed in addition to position-based packet forwarding strategies.

To protect network infrastructures from routers that incorrectly drop packets and misroute packets, we hypothesize failure models for routers and present protocols that detect and respond to those misbehaving routers. Based on realistic assumptions, we prove that our protocols have the following properties: (1) A well-behaved router never incorrectly claims another router as a misbehaving router; (2) If a network has misbehaving routers, one or more of them can be located; (3) Misbehaving routers will eventually be removed.","10.1.1.3.4523":"Directional antennas o#er tremendous potential for improving the performance of ad hoc networks.

The second is the interaction between TCP and MAC layer backoff timers which causes severe unfairness and capture conditions. We show that these effects are particularly pronounced in two families of MAC protocols that have been extensively used in ad-hoc network simulation and implementations, namely CSMA and FAMA (a descendent of MACA). We then demonstrate that these problems are in part overcome by using MACAW, a MAC layer protocol which extends MACA by adding link level ACKs and a less aggressive backoff policy. We argue that link level protection, backoff policy and selective queue scheduling are critical elements for efficient and fair opera...","10.1.1.40.5588":"An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: 1. Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. 2. A message can be \"signed\" using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature.

Geocasting is a variant of the conventional multicasting problem. For multicasting, conventional protocols define a multicast group as a collection of hosts which register to a multicast group address. However, for geocasting, the group consists of the set of all nodes within a specified geographical region. Hosts within the specified region at a given time form the geocast group at that time. We present two different algorithms for delivering packets to such a group, and present simulation results. 1 Introduction  When an application must send the same information to more than one destination, multicasting is often used, because it is much more advantageous than multiple unicasts in terms of the communication costs. Cost considerations are all the more important for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) consisting of mobile hosts that communicate with each other over wireless links, in the absence ...","10.1.1.41.838":"Using directional antennas can be beneficial for wireless ad hoc networks consisting of a collection of wireless hosts. To best utilize directional antennas, a suitable Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol must be designed.

In this paper, we attempt to design new MAC protocols suitable for ad hoc networks based on directional antennas.  Keywords---MAC protocols, Directional Antennas, Ad Hoc Networks.  I.

We analyse several well-known key establishment protocols for mobile communications. The protocols are examined with respect to their security and suitability in mobile environments. In a number of cases weaknesses are pointed out, and in many cases refinements are suggested, either to improve the efficiency or to allow simplified security analysis. 1 Introduction  Security is a critical issue in mobile radio applications, both for the users and providers of such systems. Although the same may be said of all communications systems, mobile applications have special requirements and vulnerabilities, and are therefore of special concern. Once a call has been set up by establishing various security parameters, the problem is reduced to that of employing appropriate cryptographic algorithms to provide the required security services. The most important problem is undoubtedly that of designing protocols for authentication and key management as part of the call set-up process; security-criti...","10.1.1.47.1724":"We present the source-tree adaptive routing (STAR) protocol and analyze its performance in wireless networks with broadcast radio links. Routers in STAR communicate to its neighbors their source routing trees either incrementally or in atomic updates. Source routing trees are specified by stating the link parameters of each link belonging to the paths used to reach every destination. Hence, a router disseminates link-state updates to its neighbors for only those links along paths used to reach destinations. Simulation results show that STAR is an order of magnitude more efficient than any topology-broadcast protocol, and four times more efficient than ALP, which was the most efficient table-driven routing protocol based on partial link-state information reported to date. The results also show that STAR is even more efficient than the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol, which has been shown to be one of the best performing on-demand routing protocols.","10.1.1.47.6145":"A method for anomaly detection is introduced in which \"normal\" is defined by short-range correlations in a process ' system calls.

A search-update occurs after a successful search, when the location information corresponding to the searched host is updated at some hosts. Various strategies can be designed for search, update and search-update. Static  location management uses one fixed combination of search, update and search-update strategies.

The forwarding strategy augments the basic location strategy proposed in existing standards such as GSM and IS-41, with the objective of reducing network signalling and database loads in exchange for increased CPU processing and memory costs. The key observation behind forwarding is that if users change PCS registration areas frequently but receive calls relatively infrequently, it should be possible to avoid registrations at the Home Location Register (HLR) database, by simply setting up a forwarding pointer from the previous Visitor Location Register (VLR). Calls to a given user will first query the user's HLR to determine the first VLR which the user was registered at, and then follow a chain of forwarding pointers to the user's current VLR.

In this paper, we describe power-managed systems using a finite-state, stochastic model. Furthermore, we show that the fundamental problem of finding an optimal policy which maximizes the average performance level of a system, subject to a constraint on the power consumption, can be formulated as a stochastic optimization problem called policy optimization. Policy optimization can be solved exactly in polynomial time (in the number of states of the model). We implemented a policy optimization tool and tested the quality of the optimal policies on a realistic case study.","10.1.1.50.197":"The process of finding a unit in a mobile communications system is called paging and requires the use of limited network resources.

Since unit mobility usually implies some degree of location uncertainty, the unit must be polled in various locations until found. This process is called paging. Since polling requires use of network signaling resources, we seek methods which minimize the amount of signaling required while still mainta...","10.1.1.50.2149":"Most of the solutions proposed to support real-time (i.e. guaranteed performance) communication services in packetswitching networks adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In such an approach, resource allocation and route selection decisions are made before the start of the communication on the basis of resource availability and realtime network load at that time, and are usually kept for the duration of the communication. This rather static resource management approach has certain limitations: it does not take into account (a) the dynamics of the communicating clients; (b) the dynamics of the network state; and (c) the tradeoff between quality of service and network availability, thus affecting the availability and flexibility of the real-time network services.

Given that the probability distribution on the user location as a function of time is either known or can be calculated, previous work shows the existence of lower bounds on the average cost of paging. Here these bounds are used in conjunction with a Poisson incoming-call arrival model to formulate the paging/registration optimization problem in terms of timeout  parameters, ø m ; the maximum amount of time to wait before registering given the last known location was m. Timer-based methods, as opposed to location-based methods, do not require the user to record and process location information during the time between location updates.

Traditional approaches hide handoff support from the subscriber. However, the main difficulty in handoff support stems from terminal mobility which can only be controlled by the subscriber, who may again have different requirements of mobility support under different environments. Therefore, we suggest that the subscriber should participate in handoff support in the following manner: first, the subscriber is encouraged to declare the requirement of mobility support at call setup time; second, when a handoff cannot be supported, the subscriber should be informed in advance so that (s)he can decide whether or not to control movement since a subscriber may sacrifice mobility for maintaining communication in progress.

Two implementations that generate networks whose topology resembles that of typical internetworks are described, together with publicly available source code. 1 Introduction The explosive growth of networking, and particularly of the Internet, has been accompanied by a wide range of internetworking problems related to routing, resource reservation, and administration.

In this section we are interested in the updates to the routing tables at each PBS in the  K. Y. Eng et al. / A Wireless Broadband Ad-Hoc ATM Local-Area Network 17 case of a failure. A tree and a routing table is shown in Fig. 13. First, we would like to illustrate that in the case of a link failure, updating the routing tables at the affected transmitter node is not sufficient. This is shown in Fig. 14 for the routing tree of Fig. 13. When the affected PBS reroutes traffic as shown, a cycle is generated in the tree, since the traffic is deflected to a PBS that transmits incoming cells back to the affected PBS in accordance with the original tree designation. Although from a simplicity viewpoint, regular deflection networking would be desirable in this network, it does not work since deflection routing works well only for networks with regular topologies, but for networks with arbitrary topologies, such as ours, it does not work. The optimum remedy to the problem is in calculating the optimum tree as if the failed link were disconnected, and updating the routing tables at each PBS. Various centralized or distributed algorithms exist for this purpose. Without getting into algorithm specifics, we describe centralized and distributed alternatives below. The first issue is the detection of failure. In the case of full duplex links, the failure is detected by both ends of the link failure. However, common failures involve transmitter and receiver failures in the case of optical links, and it is therefore safe to conclude that the failures should be detected by the receiving PBS. The second issue is the propagation of this information to the agent that will make the rerouting decision.

Either the source knows the direct route to the mobile host, and is informed of all location changes by the mobile host (informed routing), or the source directs messages to a home agent that forwards messages to the mobile host (triangle routing). When the rate at which the mobile host changes location and the rate at which messages are directed to the mobile host are known and fixed, we show that the optimal routing policy is described by a threshold rule that depends on the normalized differential route cost between triangle and informed routing and the call to mobility ratio (source messaging rate divided by location update rate). Since the call to mobility ratio may not be known a priori or may change slowly with time, we also derive an adaptive policy selection algorithm. The policy is derived from a maximum likelihood estimate of the call to mobility ratio based on observations of message arrivals and l...","10.1.1.58.1857":"The IEEE 802.11 standards support the peer-to-peer mode Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS), which is an ad hoc network with all its stations within each other's transmission range.

Synchronization is necessary for frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) to ensure that all stations \"hop\" at the same time; it is also necessary for both FHSS and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) to perform power management. This paper evaluates the synchronization mechanism, which is a distributed algorithm, specified in the IEEE 802.11 standards. By both analysis and simulation, it is shown that when the number of stations in an IBSS is not very small, there is a non-negligible probability that stations may get out of synchronization. The more stations, the higher probability of asynchronism. Thus, the current IEEE 802.11's synchronization mechanism does not scale; it cannot support a large-scale ad hoc network. To alleviate the asynchronism problem, this paper proposes a simple modification to the current synchronization algorithm. The modified algorithm is shown to work well for large ad hoc networks.","10.1.1.58.3631":"In a wireless ad hoc network with multihop transmissions and interference-limited link rates, can we balance power control in the physical layer and congestion control in the transport layer to enhance the overall network performance, while maintaining the stability, robustness, and architectural modularity of the network?

Under the rigorous framework of nonlinearly constrained optimization, we prove the convergence of this coupled system to the global optimum of joint power control and congestion control, for both synchronized and asynchronous implementations. The rate of convergence is geometric and a desirable modularity between the transport and physical layers is maintained. In particular, when the congestion control mechanism is TCP Vegas, that a simple utilization in the physical layer of the router buffer occupancy information suffices to achieve the joint optimum of this cross layer design.

MDC is more effective when the underlying application has a very stringent delay constraint and the round trip time on each path is relatively long. LC can be a good alternative when limited retransmission of the base layer is acceptable and when it is feasible to apply unequal error protection over different paths.

One of the major challenges in devising such networks lies in the constrained energy and computational resources available to sensor nodes. These constraints must be taken into account at all levels of system hierarchy. The deployment of sensor nodes is the first step in establishing a sensor network. Since sensor networks contain a large number of sensor nodes, the nodes must be deployed in clusters, where the location of each particular node cannot be fully guaranteed a priori. Therefore, the number of nodes that must be deployed in order to completely cover the whole monitored area is often higher than if a deterministic procedure were used. In networks with stochastically placed nodes, activating only the necessary number of sensor nodes at any particular moment can save energy. We introduce a heuristic that selects mutually exclusive sets of sensor nodes, where the members of each of those sets together completely cover the monitored area. The intervals of activity are the same for all sets, and only one of the sets is active at any time. The experimental results demonstrate that by using only a subset of sensor nodes at each moment, we achieve a significant energy savings while fully preserving coverage.

In distance, progress, and direction-based approaches (reported in the literature), when node A wants to send or forward message m to destination node D, it forwards m to its neighbor C which is closest to D (has best progress toward D, whose direction is closest to the direction of D, respectively) among all neighbors of A. The same procedure is repeated until D, if possible, is eventually reached. The algorithms are referred to as GEDIR, MFR, and DIR when a common failure criterion is introduced: The algorithm stops if the best choice for the current node is the node from which the message came. We propose 2-hop GEDIR, DIR, and MFR methods in which node A selects the best candidate node C among its 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors according to the corresponding criterion and forwards m to its best 1-hop neighbor among joint neighbors of A and C. We then propose flooding GEDIR and MFR and hybrid single-path/flooding GEDIR and MFR methods which are the first localized algorithms (other than full flooding) to guarantee the message delivery (in a collision-free environment). We show that the directional routing methods are not loopfree, while the GEDIR and MFR-based methods are inherently loop free. The simulation experiments, with static random graphs, show that GEDIR and MFR have similar success rates, which is low for low degree graphs and high for high degree ones. When successful, their hop counts are near the performance of the shortest path algorithm. Hybrid single-path/flooding GEDIR and MFR methods have low communication overheads. The results are also confirmed by experiments with moving nodes and MAC layer.

Because research has only begun to scratch the surface of the potential applications of this technology, it is important to prepare for the widespread use of these networks. In anticipation of their ubiquity, the protocols designed for these networks must be scalable. This includes scaling to both networks with many nodes, and networks with rapidly changing topologies. This paper presents two hierarchical clustering protocols that improve the scalability of ad hoc routing protocols. The Adaptive Routing using Clusters (ARC) protocol creates a one-level clustered hierarchy across an ad hoc network, while the Adaptive Routing using Clustered Hierarchies (ARCH) protocol creates a multi-level hierarchy which is able to dynamically adjust the depth of the hierarchy in response to the changing network topology. It is experimentally shown that these protocols, when coupled with an ad hoc routing protocol, produce throughput improvements of up to 80 % over the ad hoc routing protocol alone. 1","10.1.1.94.7634":"Abstract. In a distributed system, one strategy for achieving mutual exclusion of groups of nodes without communication is to assign to each node a number of votes. Only a group with a majority of votes can execute the critical operations, and mutual exclusion is achieved because at any given time there is at most one such group. A second strategy, which appears to be similar to votes, is to define a priori a set of groups that intersect each other. Any group of nodes that finds itself in this set can perform the restricted operations. In this paper, both of these strategies are studied in detail and it is shown that they are not equivalent in general (although they are in some cases). In doing so, a number of other interesting properties are proved. These properties will be of use to a system designer who is selecting a vote assignment or a set of groups for a specific application.","10.1.1.94.8389":"Significant TCP unfairness in ad hoc wireless networks has been reported during the past several years. This unfairness results from the nature of the shared wireless medium and location dependency. If we view a node and its interfering nodes to form a “neighborhood”, the aggregate of local queues at these nodes represents the distributed queue for this neighborhood. However, this queue is not a FIFO queue. Flows sharing the queue have different, dynamically changing priorities determined by the topology and traffic patterns. Thus, they get different feedback in terms of packet loss rate and packet delay when congestion occurs. In wired networks, the Randomly Early Detection (RED) scheme was found to improve TCP fairness. In this paper, we show that the RED scheme does not work when running on individual queues in wireless nodes. We then propose a Neighborhood RED (NRED) scheme, which extends the RED concept to the distributed neighborhood queue.

High routing load usually has a significant performance impact in low bandwidth wireless links. While DSR and AODV share the on-demand behavior =-=[13]-=- in that they initiate routing activities only in the presence of data packets in need of a route, many of their routing mechanics are very different. In particular, DSR uses source routing, but AODV  aches the source route in a packet it forwards for possible future use. Several additional optimizations have been proposed and have been evaluated to be very effective by the authors of the protocol =-=[13]-=-, as described in the following. (i) Salvaging: An intermediate node can use an alternate route from its own cache, when a data packet meets a failed link on its source route. (ii) Gratuitous route re tination. Third, the current specification of DSR does not contain any explicit mechanism to expire stale routes in the cache, or prefer “fresher” routes when faced with multiple choices. As noted in =-=[13]-=-, stale routes, if used, may start polluting other caches. Some stale entries are indeed deleted by route error packets. But because of promiscuous listening and node mobility, it is possible that mor ket counts. Presenting routing loads in terms of bytes is, however, less impressive (at most about 20%). By the virtue of aggressive caching DSR’s cache hit ratio is high (an observation also made in =-=[13]-=-). Thus DSR rarely resorts to a route discovery process unlike AODV, but generates more replies and errors (gratuitous or otherwise). Thus, even with a carefully optimized route discovery process, we","to carry out a systematic performance study of two dynamic routing protocols for ad hoc networks — Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) [10], [3] and Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector protocol (AODV) =-=[14]-=-, [15].

AODV AODV =-=[14]-=-, [15] shares DSR’s on-demand characteristics in that it also discovers routes on an “as needed” basis via a similar route discovery process. However, AODV adopts a very different mechanism to maintai ource and, subsequently, to route data packets to the destination. AODV uses sequence numbers maintained at each destination to determine freshness of routing information and to prevent routing loops =-=[14]-=-. These sequence numbers are carried by all routing packets. An important feature of AODV is maintenance of timerbased states in each node, regarding utilization of individual routing table entries.

For years, NTP (the Network Time Protocol) =-=[24]-=- has kept the Internet’s clocks ticking in phase. However, a new class of networks is emerging. Recent advances in miniaturization and lowcost, low-power design have led to active research in large-sc e propagation delay of sound [9], and thus absolute time may not be needed. Over the years, many protocols have been designed for maintaining synchronization of physical clocks over computer networks =-=[5, 10, 24, 30]-=-. These protocols all have basic features in common: a simple connectionless messaging protocol; exchange of clock information among clients and one or more servers; methods for mitigating the effects network is kept internally consistent or synchronized to an external standard; whether the server is considered to be the canonical clock, or merely an arbiter of client clocks, and so on. Mills’ NTP =-=[24]-=- stands out by virtue of its scalability, self-configuration in large multi-hop networks, robustness to failures and sabotage, and ubiquitous deployment. NTP allows construction of a hierarchy of time","to the nondeterminism in the latency. Mills attributes most of the phase error seen when synchronizing an NTP client workstation to a GPS receiver on the same LAN (500µsec–2000µsec in his 1994 study =-=[25]-=-) to these factors—Ethernet jitter and collisions. To counteract these effects, an RBS broadcast is always used as a relative time reference, never to communicate an absolute time value. It is exactly","ount—in the time needed to observe 30 pulses, the phase error between the clocks will have changed. Complex disciplines exist that can lock an oscillator’s phase and frequency to an external standard =-=[26]-=-. However, we selected a very simple yet effective algorithm to correct skew. Instead of averaging the phase offsets from multiple observations, as shown in Equation 1, we perform a least-squares line","related to our work are the CesiumSpray system [32] (the foundations of which were described by Veríssimo and Rodrigues [31]), and the 802.11-based broadcast synchronization described by Mock et al. =-=[27]-=-.

However, their methods require all nodes to lie within a single broadcast domain; mult","nodes can perform successive time conversions on packets as they are forwarded from node to node—keeping the time with respect to the local clock at each hop.

These numbers correspond to the TR1000 radio from RF Monolithics [15] where the transmit range is set to approximately 20 meters =-=[4]-=-. This low-power radio has a data rate of 2.4 Kbps and uses OOK modulation. Table I.

Existing topology management schemes, such as the ones described in references =-=[5]-=- and [6], are based on the observation that in typical scenarios, some nodes can be asleep without sacrificing significant data forwarding capacity. As density increases, more nodes can be sleeping, r ossibly hierarchical, our scheme can be used to reduce the energy of the cluster heads, although the gains are expected to be less dramatic here. Recently, topology management techniques, called SPAN =-=[5]-=- and GAF [6], have been proposed for flat multi-hop routing. They operate on the assumption that the network capacity needs to be preserved. As a result, the energy consumption is approximately the sa independent of network density. It operates in an orthogonal dimension, that of setup latency. Our hybrid scheme, which we describe in section 6, leverages both network density and latency. With SPAN =-=[5]-=-, a limited set of nodes forms a multihop forwarding backbone that tries to preserve the original capacity of the underlying ad-hoc network. Other nodes transition to sleep states more frequently, as","the sleep transitions of all the nodes, while ensuring that data can be forwarded efficiently to the data sink.

Recently, topology management techniques, called SPAN [5] and GAF =-=[6]-=-, have been proposed for flat multi-hop routing. They operate on the assumption that the network capacity needs to be preserved. As a result, the energy consumption is approximately the same whether t er nodes. To balance out energy consumption, the backbone functionality is rotated between nodes, and as such, there is a strong interaction with the routing layer. Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) =-=[6]-=- exploits the fact that nearby nodes can perfectly and transparently replace each other in the routing topology. The sensor network is subdivided into small grids, such that nodes in the same grid are EM. Furthermore, we also analyze its behavior theoretically, as this is an essential building block in the analysis of STEM combined with GAF. Such analysis was not provided in the original GAF paper =-=[6]-=-. 9 The GAF algorithm is based on a division of the sensor network in a number of virtual grids of size r by r, see Figure 10. The value of r is chosen such that all nodes in a grid are equivalent fro s that any two nodes in adjacent grids should be able to communicate with each other. By investigating the worst-case node locations depicted in Figure 10, we can calculate that r should satisfy (26) =-=[6]. r -=-≤ r R 5 Figure 10 – GAF grid structure (26) The average number of nodes in a grid, M, is given by (27).

An approach that is closely related to STEM is the use of a separate paging channel to wake up nodes that have turned off their main radio =-=[10]-=-. However, the paging channel radio cannot be put in the sleep mode for obvious reasons. This approach thus critically assumes that the paging radio is much lower power than the one used for regular d","ON 5.1. Simulation Setup In this section, we verify our algorithm and theoretical analysis through simulations, which were written on the Parsec platform, an event-driven parallel simulation language =-=[12]-=-. We distribute N nodes in a uniformly random fashion over a field of size L x L. Each node has a transmission range R.

Thus, we assume a location registration and lookup service that maps node addresses to locations =-=[18]-=-. Queries to this system use the same geographic routing system as data packets; the querier geographically addresses his request to a location server. The scope of this paper is limited to geographic kets with destinations' positions. Our results here argue that the GPSR approach to routing warrants investigation into efficient location databases, and related work is already underway in this area =-=[18]-=-. In these simulation results, we use an idealized location database: each source annotates packets it originates with the true location of the destination. In this sense, our results represent the lo se case. Under LAR, DSR's routes are still end-to-end source routes. Geography is not used for data packet forwarding decisions under LAR; only to scope routing protocol packet propagation.

To our knowledge, however, such schemes require the intervention of the network layer. For example, the BA-TCP (Bandwidth Aware-TCP) scheme =-=[10]-=- relies on intermediate routers to take measurements of available bandwidth and compute the “fair share” for the TCP connections. The fair share value is piggybacked in the TCP header and conveyed to  rmly satisfied for various error causes and various link technologies, thus the limitation in versatility of ELN in addition to its limited gain over Reno. We compared, via simulation, TCPW to BA-TCP =-=[10]-=-, an alternative strategy where the routers explicitly measure and relay the bandwidth available for each connection back to the TCP sender. At 40ms round trip time, and 1 bit in 100KB error rate, BA-",null,null,null,"vergence to fair share An important goal of any TCP implementation is for every connection to get its “fair share” of the bottleneck. We will use an informal argument similar to that used for Reno in =-=[14]-=- to show that TCPW achieves the fair share. Consider the case of two connections with the same RTTs. Suppose, for the sake of example, that the RTT is X packet transmission times, and the bottleneck h","sed by that connection as: b k = t k d k − t k−1 where t k−1 is the time the previous ACK was received.

Notice that this averaging is also critical to filter out the noise","UDP traffic rate. TCPW window dynamics (cwin, ssthresh and sequence numbers) are then considered.

This hints at a significant advantage to using parallel information transmission. In this simple example we  ssibility of advantage must be carefully assessed. We will do this in Section 4 analytically and then numerically in Sections 5–7. Drawing on (4) we will see, that in contrast to what is expressed by =-=(5)-=-, with certain MEA arrangements there is a very significant capacity improvement with increasing n. It is helpful to consider (5) in terms of a specific example of n uncoupled transmission lines (H =   in an (1; n 0 ) MCC system. With MCC, as bandwidth increases, capacity, measured in bps/Hz, does not have the linear growth with n feature of an (n; n) system. A simple extension of the argument for =-=(5)-=- using n adjacent bands instead of n modes shows this.

In that case the proof of (13) follows easily from nT applications of Equation =-=(6)-=-, one for each statistically independent row of the H matrix. This is because the squared modulus of the entries of the H matrix are each independent chi-squared with two degrees of freedom.

Its outage perf nce is seen to far surpass that of (1, 1). This curve is followed on the right by two =-=(1, 8)-=- curves. The middle of the three curves is selection diversity while the rightmost (best of the three) is OC(8). At the low outage tail (ccdf near 100%) somewhat superior to OC(8) is an (8, 8) curve corresponding to using all eight transmitters by simply cycling through all eight in sequence, using only one tr h increasing n than for the full (nn) capacity which requires all n transmitters to be used simultaneously.

Beside being  the mathematical details associated with results we have stated on the more complex of the cases we are addressing, namely, cases (D) and (E). First we deal with the lower bound on capacity given by =-=(12)-=-. We will also include an asymptotic, large n, analysis of this bound. Secondly, we give the mathematical justification for (13). This justification will prove quite useful since the essentials of the (n)=n of C(n)=n. It is convenient to study the sequence of random variables [L(n)=n]n>0 via a perturbation analysis with (1=n) the perturbation parameter.

One-hop throughput is similiar in concept to the bit-meter/second unit proposed in =-=[8]-=-. Figure 10 shows that one-hop throughput scales roughly linearly with the area of network. The actual slope of the curve depends on how effectively 802.11 schedules packet transmissions. The points m is proportional to the number of nodes, n.

I. INTRODUCTION Wireless systems have emerged as a ubiquitous part of modern data communication networks. Demand for these systems continues to grow as applications involving both voice and data exp  static equilibrium point which maximizes some function of user utility. Asymptotic analysis of capacity regions for large, static wireless networks is provided in [11,12], and for mobile networks in =-=[13]-=-. Our work is inspired by the approach of Tassiulas in [14], where a Lyapunov drift technique is used to develop a throughput optimal link scheduling policy for a multi-hop packet radio network. Furth we implement both a centralized and a decentralized version of the policy for an ad-hoc wireless network with mobility, and simulate the system to compare with the Grossglauser-Tse relay algorithm of =-=[13]-=-. II. THE SYSTEM MODEL Consider the N node system of Fig. 1. We represent the channel process by the channel state matrix S(t) =(Sab(t)), where Sab(t) represents the current state of channel (a, b) (r but is designed to demonstrate a simple distributed implementation. The random transmitter selection in the above algorithm is similar to the technique used in the Grossglauser-Tse relay algorithm of =-=[13]-=-. However, rather than transmitting to the nearest receiver, the algorithm chooses the receiver to improve the backlog-rate metric given in (22). It can be shown to achieve a stability region that con f the steepest ascent search may be sub-optimal. We simulate the centralized and decentralized implementations of DRPC and compare to the performance offered by the 2-hop relay algorithm presented in =-=[13]-=-. The relay algorithm restricts routes to 2-hop paths, and hence relies on rapid user mobility for delivering data. We set the sender density parameter of the relay algorithm to 1/2. Note that the rel",null,"punov analysis similar to Theorems 2 and 3 for the iid case can be used in this Markov modulated context by considering a group of K timeslots as a ‘super-timeslot.’ Similar analysis has been used=-= in [15]-=- for link scheduling in single-hop networks with Markovian channel conditions. Notice that the performance bound for iid inputs in (23) is linear in the timeslot length. Correspondingly, bounds for Ma","at the unfinished work in the queue exceeds the value M. Stability in this case is identical to the usual notion of stability defined in terms of a vanishing complementary occupancy distribution (see =-=[21,20,14,16,17]). A-=- network of queues is said to be stable if all individual queues are stable. Consider a network of K queues with unfinished work levels Uk(t),k =1, ..., K, and define: gk(M) = lim sup t→∞ gsum(M)  ffers similar performance without requiring knowledge of the input and channel statistics. We start by presenting a preliminary lemma which makes use of a well developed theory of Lyapunov drift (see =-=[21,17,18,16,14]-=-). A.

We start by presenting a preliminary lemma which makes use of a well developed theory of Lyapunov drift (see =-=[21,17,18,16,14]-=-). A. Lyapunov Drift Let U(t) = (U (c) i (t)) represent the matrix of unfinished work in the wireless network, where (U (c) i (t)) represents the amount of commodity c bits in the output queue of node ed work matrix U. Below we present a simple condition which guarantees network stability and provides a performance bound. The lemma combines the steady state analysis for Lyapunov drift presented in =-=[21]-=- and the delay analysis in [17] into a simple statement useful for stability and performance analysis in our wireless network.

Such structural properties are used in the proof of the following theorem. Theorem 1. (Capacity Region for a Wireless Network) (a) A necess obabilities (qS 1 ,... ,qS k ).

A number of extensive simulation studies on various MANET routing protocols have been performed by various researchers [25][5]=-=[16]-=-[8][7].

By far the most extensive implementation study to date was conducted by Maltz et al. =-=[17]-=- in describing their implementation of DSR. Unlike previous work, our work reports on the experience of building an operational ad-hoc network that is capable of carrying useful data. We report severa ute. Very little user data would be transmitted over this unreliable route and user sessions would hang pending the reestablishment of the more reliable two hop route. In a related work, Maltz et al. =-=[17]-=- reported similar behavior while building a MANET testbed and experimenting with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) routing protocol. The following modifications to DSR were suggested to overcome the proble","s selecting for lowest hop routes, regardless of any sort of measure of route quality. As stated in the introduction a similar effect for the DSR routing protocol has been observed on another testbed =-=[18]-=-. We found that it was practically impossible to establish a stable telnet session between nodes over a three or four hop route on our testbed. For example when using the topology described in Figure  of stability metric after a route has been established to avoid the transfer of route as soon as a better signal link becomes available. A similar approach to powerwave was also taken by Maltz et al. =-=[18]-=- where a program called macfilter was developed to filter out traffic from unwanted MAC addresses. A novel usage of macfilter was the emulation of a MANET where multiple nodes could be placed closely  in question. An interesting conclusion from Matlz et al.’s work was that ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communications Review Volume 32, Number 5: November 2002 56sthey found neighbor selection to be important =-=[18]-=-.

The choice of routing protocols was pragmatically based on what (little) was available at the time this work was carried out. The AODV implementation was the freely available MAD-HO hosen due to it’s relative simplicity and the fact that it is a table based protocol rather than an ”on demand” protocol like AODV. Our implementation was based largely on the paper by Perkins et al. =-=[20]-=-. Both protocols were deployed on a five hop, four node testbed based on Linux workstations and 802.11b wireless LAN cards configured to use the Lucent ad hoc mode. We found that neither protocol coul e [21]. The time-to-live (TTL) field is used in RREQs for an expanding ring search to control flooding. Successive RREQs use larger TTLs to increase the search for destination node. Unlike AODV, DSDV =-=[20]-=- is a table-driven (or proactive) routing protocol and is essentially based on the basic distributed Bellman-Ford routing algorithm [1]. Each node in the network maintains a routing table consisting o licity proved valuable during our experimentation especially when explaining the poor operation of DSDV on our testbed. Our DSDV implementation was based on the ACM SIGCOMM’94 paper by Perkins et al. =-=[20]-=- with the addition of a neighbor handshake protocol to check for bi-directional links. Our DSDV implementation used the Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT) [19] for platform independence and for inte s of the same hop count.

It was found that such a mechanism was cruc","unnecessarily prolonged route construction and required tunning before an acceptable performance could be achieved. The parameters we changed are listed on Table 1. AODV’s parameters as specified in =-=[21]-=- are left to the implementors, however recent drafts have used more conservative parameters than those in the MAD-HOC implementation shown in Table 1. BCAST ID SAVE is used to prevent over flooding of elines or heuristics for setting AODV’s parameters or adapting them to a given network. The parameters shown in Table 1, and the other AODV parameters that have been defined in the AODV specification =-=[21]-=-, would most likely have to be modified for use in other networks. 5.3.2 ARP Interactions The reliance of the MAD-HOC AODV implementation on sniffing ARP packets to signal the need for route construct","ing transmitted directly from one end node to the other.

For example, after a node detects a broken link and returns a ROUTE ERROR to the original sender of a packet, the node may attempt to salvage the packet if it has in its own Route Cache a different  hysical and virtual carrier sensing for collision avoidance. For the base version of DSR without implicit source routing, we used the latest simulation code for DSR available from the Monarch Project =-=[5]-=-. The Route Cache we used is the “Link-MaxLife” cache, which is a link state cache in which link timeouts are chosen dynamically based on observed usage and errors. The cache also attempts to choose t","e discarded earlier, for example due to node failures, without impacting correctness.

In recent years, there has also been a focus on the fundamental question of what the optimal throughput of a multi-hop wireless network is.

We use our technique to evaluate how the per-node throughput in a multi-hop wireless network varies as the number of nodes grows. Previous work (e.g., =-=[14]-=-) suggests that the per-node throughput falls as the number of 2 nodes grows. But this result is under the assumption that nodes always have data to send and are ready to transmit as fast as their wir mber of papers have been published on the problem of estimating the throughput of a multi-hop wireless network. Here, we consider the work that is most closely related to ours. In their seminal paper =-=[14]-=-, Gupta and Kumar studied the throughput of wireless networks under two models of interference: a protocol model that assumes interference to be an all-or-nothing phenomenon and a physical model that  e overall one-hop throughput of the network grows as O(n), the average path length grows as O( √ n), so the throughput per node is O( 1 √ n ).

They assume a limited model of interference in which the only  o our algorithm only provides upper and lower bounds on optimal throughput.

MACA/PR=-=[20]-=- is a protocol based on MACAW with the provision of non-persistent CSMA (as in FAMA). In addition, MACA/PR supports real-time data traffic by including a reservation mechanism in the RTS-CTS-PacketACK s unable to either transmit or receive a packet. In section 3.1 we discussed how a node knows when and for how long to power off. If we are to incorporate power awareness in other multiaccess schemes =-=[5, 12, 20]-=- we need to develop similar protocols that will enable a node to determine when and for how long it needs to power off.

Design Rationale When constructing a multi-hop network using off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware, typically one uses a single ad-hoc network (SSID =-=[12]-=-) and therefore all nodes that participate in that network end up using the same channel. Unfortunately, even when multiple 802.11 NICs are present on the host, each NIC converges on the same physical","four goals. First, MUP must not require hardware modifications.

Second, MUP must not require any changes to existing application, transport, or routing protocols. Third, MUP must interoperate with legacy hardware. Fourth work interfaces used by MUP allow probes packets to be sent at a higher priority or to be placed at the head of the NIC transmit queue. Such support is available as part of the 802.11e draft standard =-=[13]-=-, and 802.11e hardware is expected to be available within a few months.

One change is the increased queue size in the intermediate nodes of the connection, resulting in an increase of the the average of the minimum and maximum RTTs seen so far. If it is, then the algorithm decreases the congestion window by one-eighth.

Several alternatives/enhancements to these standards have been proposed that employ either a centralized approach [8, 9] or a distributed approach =-=[2, 16]-=-. In this paper we present a distributed location management scheme in which fast location updates and queries can be performed, while incurring modest communication and storage overheads. Also, unlik may incur extra delays during location queries. Depending on the call-to-mobility ratio, the two approaches lead to varying degrees of performance improvement. Distributed location management schemes =-=[2, 15, 16]-=- employ hierarchical databases such that each database need not store location information about every M H in the system. The basic idea is to have a tree structure with the mobile hosts as the leaves robed to find the location of the target node. If location information is not found at the ith level regional directories, the region of search is expanded by probing higher level directories. So, in =-=[2]-=-, multiple rounds of probes may be required. If a mobile host is highly mobile, the time to locate it will be greater. Moreover, there has been a trend towards reduction of cell size, i:e:, there is a city during the morning and evening rush-hour traffic, and most of the M Hs may be concentrated in the business districts of the city during rest of the day. In such situations, the directory servers =-=[2]-=- and reporting centers [3] in the high density regions will be overburdened, while the directory servers and reporting centers in other regions will be comparatively lightly loaded. Hence, it is desir","node and M H pairs. Nodes in the working set are informed about the location update when an M H moves, while other nodes are made to search for the M H when they wish to communicate with the M H. In =-=[3]-=-, some mobile service stations (M SSs) are designated as reporting centers (similar to location servers). Location update is done when an M H moves into the cells corresponding to the reporting center d evening rush-hour traffic, and most of the M Hs may be concentrated in the business districts of the city during rest of the day. In such situations, the directory servers [2] and reporting centers =-=[3]-=- in the high density regions will be overburdened, while the directory servers and reporting centers in other regions will be comparatively lightly loaded. Hence, it is desirable that the location ser s to start looking for the mobile host in the vicinity of the cell indicated by the outdated location information, and slowly expand the region of search. This is similar to the approach described in =-=[3]-=-. 5.4 Accuracy of Location Operations We define accuracy of location operations as a qualitative measure for the collective performance of the two location operations: update and query. Accuracy indic","g one cell per registration area) can be very expensive. Three alternatives, namely, timebased, number of movements-based, and distance-based strategies for M H location updates have been proposed in =-=[4]-=-. So, the size of an RA is not static. Instead, it depends on the mobility characteristics of the M H. In this paper we assume that a policy to determine the size and layout of registration areas (RAs ocation information about a hot M H either stores location information about fewer M Hs, and/or receives only half the queries corresponding to the hot M H. 2If location update conditions proposed in =-=[4]-=- were to be employed then the interval between successive location updates for an MH would depend on the triggering threshold set for the time-based, number of movements-based, or distance-based polic","location servers get overloaded while others are not so heavily loaded. Load Balancing with Dynamic Hashing A solution to the problem mentioned above is to employ a family of universal hash functions =-=[5]-=-. Periodically, the system can switch from one hash function in the family to the other. This ensures that even if a particular hash function does not provide good load balancing under certain circums le virtual identities are used for fine grain load balancing. 2. Given an M SS id, denoting the cell in which the mobile host is present, and a V M H id for that mobile host, we employ double hashing =-=[5]-=-, as follows: h(M SS id; V M H id) = (h 0(M SS id) + V M H id \\Thetash00(M SS id)) mod m where [0,m \\Gammas1] is the range of the hash function h(), and h0() and h00() are auxiliary hash functions. Fu refore, given an (M SS id, V M H id) pair, h(M SS id; V M H id) will be uniformly distributed over the range [0, m \\Gammas1], i:e:, mapped uniformly over all the location server quorums in the system =-=[5]-=-. 3. Corresponding to each i = h(M SS id; V M H id), there is a set Si of location servers with the following properties: (a) Si 6ae Sj, for 0 ^ i; j ^ m \\Gammas1; i 6= j.

Both these schemes are centralized, and therefore  erred to as RA id, in which the queried M H is present. Once the RA id of the M H has been determined, paging is done to determine the RA's cell in which the M H is present. 3 Previous Work The IS-41 =-=[6]-=- and GSM MAP [11] standards use centralized location management schemes. For example, IS-41 associates a home location register (HLR) with each M H. When an M H moves from one RA to another the M H re","adding new location servers to the system when load increases. The new location servers can be integrated with the existing location servers using tries, a dynamic hashing technique, as described in =-=[7]-=-. Basically, if a quorum of location servers is heavily loaded, a new quorum is added to the system. Location management responsibilities of the old quorum are now shared between the old quorum and th  to the next higher hash function hi+2 hoping that such a switch will lead to the desired load balancing. In database applications such a solution is highly effective in situations of bucket overflow =-=[7]-=-.

Broadcasting updates and queries to all the location servers is a fast, but expensive solution. The locality of reference patterns is exploited in =-=[15]-=-. The notion of working set for mobile hosts is introduced. Nodes in an M H's working set communicate with the M H more frequently than nodes that are not in the working set. A location management sch s made. However, an issue that needs to be addressed is how are the number and location of reporting centers determined? Also, what should be the size of the registration area (RA) or the working set =-=[15]-=-? This is important because a large RA would mean high paging costs when the location of an M H is to be determined. A simple approach is to determine the size of RAs a priori. However, such a solutio : even though all nodes in the system can potentially communicate with a given node, bulk of the references for the given node originate from only a subset of nodes (referred to as the working set in =-=[15]-=-). The nodes in the working set may be clustered in different parts of the network. So, to reduce query costs, it is advisable to have location servers for the M H in the vicinity of such clusters.

Terminal Paging Research Because this area has not yet been explored for WATM applications, only one algorithm is considered here. 1) Velocity Paging Scheme: The velocity paging scheme outlined in =-=[117] a-=-ttempts to categorize the travel of the MT into a velocity class. The class is then used to generate a paging zone—a list of cells to be paged. The velocity classes described for the scheme characte  the MT could have traveled within the given constraints. Finally, the candidate cells that are within that maximum distance are the first group to be paged. Alternatives to this scheme, described in =-=[117]-=-, include recording the direction of the MT, paging in that direction initially, and then branching out. C. Handoff Management Research Handoff management controls the process of maintaining each conn ed a number of location update mechanisms that have been proposed to reduce the signalling cost and call delay related to location update and paging in terrestrial wireless networks [15], [56], [64], =-=[117]-=-.

However, there is no unbounded vacant region in the supercritical case (=-=see [9] p-=-p 108-116). Hence, ˜D must be bounded. As every point of D is at a finite distance of ˜ D, D must also be bounded. One can then conclude that the portion of curve between two crossings must be bound s from nodes that are connected to a base station through a bounded cluster. The quantity in which we are interested is then the fraction of bounded clusters connected to a base station. We know from =-=[9] that-=- the average number of nodes contained in a bounded cluster tends to one when λ → ∞. Therefore the probability that a bounded cluster is connected to a base station tends to the fraction of space",null,"g λ/λ, Gupta and Kumar have proven that all nodes are almost surely connected [6]. The situation is reversed when the nodes density λ becomes small. Power constraints become then a serious impedime=-=nt [11]-=-.

In this paper,  twork with n nodes under the relay traffic pattern behaves like log n bits per second. This demonstrates also that network coding is essential: under the point-topoint coding assumption considered in =-=[1]-=-, the achievable rate is constant, independent of the number of nodes. Moreover, the result of this paper has implications and extensions to fading channels and to sensor networks. I. INTRODUCTION ONE r systems [2, p. 448]. In this context, the question of the capacity of a multi-user mobile system like an ad hoc network is certainly a challenging question. In their landmark paper, Gupta and Kumar =-=[1]-=- gave a formula for the achievable global transmission rate of an adhoc network (in bit-meters per second), and under certain assumptions, showed that one could not achieve a better performance. The k question in an information theoretic sense. In other words, under the same physical constraints, but with a better coding scheme, one could achieve higher rates.

We call this model the relay network, since all nodes (except the sender and receiver nodes) act as relay for the communication. This is schematically rendered in Figure 1.

Nevertheless, the result presented in [1] certainly points out a basic behavior of current ad hoc networks.

The lower bound follows from a consideration of (almost) uncoded transmission of a particular source across the Gaussian relay network. In this sense, it can be seen as an extension to =-=[4]-=-. Note that a naive (and wrong) use of the throughput result in [1] would give O( p n) bits per second, and a more careful application of the point-topoint coding model of [1] yields O(1) only. The ou  e.g. in [9]. Are there other examples where such a simple joint sourcechannel code achieves optimum performance, and hence R( ) is equal to capacity? This question has been addressed and answered in =-=[4]-=-. As it turns out, there is an infinite supply of such examples. The key ingredient that makes our argument work is the separation theorem. In general network situations, there is no such statement; h  multiple destinations, then uncoded transmission is an optimal strategy and actually outperforms any approach based on capacity-achieving codes. Extensions of this amazing behavior were presented in =-=[4]-=-. In the second step (the multi-accessing from the relays to the destination), cooperative transmission is used to boost transmit power. It is the combination of these coding steps that yields an achi",null,"sy feedback. To our knowledge, the capacity of this channel is unknown to date. B. Previous Results The channel model described in Section III-A is an extension of the single-relay channel studied in =-=[6]-=-.

One interesting approach in this direction comes again from Gupta and Kumar.

Their approach is to consider the set of all possibl g problem is to optimize over all graphs. However, the latter (combinatorial) problem has no efficient solution to date. Moreover, while this leads to achievable rates, it has not been established in =-=[7]-=- that this approach yields capacity eventually. C.

MACA amounts to a single-channel SRMA using AL ket sensing (i.e., the transmission of RTSs without carrier sensing), which amounts to MACA or SRMA using ALOHA. Although the original motivation for such protocols as MACA, IEEE 802.11 DFWMAC, MACAW =-=[2]-=-, and BAPU [27] was to solve the hidden-terminal problems of CSMA by using RTS-CTS handshakes, it is easy to show by example that simply introducing three-way handshakes (RTS-CTS-data) or even more co t of p-persistent CSMA [15].

All terminals are within line-of-sight and range of the base station, but they may be hidden from one another. The population of terminals is partitioned into N independent groups =-=[23]-=-, such that all terminals within the same group can hear one another and the base station, and any two terminals from different groups are hidden from each other. All traffic is directed from the term re FAMA-NCS and CSMA in wireless LANs with independent groups hidden from one another, and with one common central station.

RCS: Rate Control Scheme RCS is an end-to-end rate control scheme which uses additive-increase, multiplicative decrease (AIMD) =-=[7]-=-, in order to produce TCP-friendly traffic flows while maintaining high throughput performance in networks with high bandwidth-delay products and high bit error rates. SOURCE DESTINATION DECODER RTCP   uses the variable wdsn in order to be TCP friendly. C. Steady State Behavior In the Steady state, RCS source assumes that the network is not congested. Thus, according to the additiveincrease scheme =-=[7]-=-, it increases its transmission rate in a step-like fashion periodically. Moreover, upon receiving an ACK for a dummy packet, the RCS source checks the value of the variable wdsn. If wdsn is greater t  and is given by IPG = 1=S, where S is data transmission rate. ffl t next increase : it is the time instant when the transmission rate, S, must be increased. According to the additive increase scheme =-=[7]-=-, S is increased periodically in a steplike fashion.

APPROXIMATE THROUGHPUT ANALYSIS The objective of our analysis is to calculate the throughput achieved with RICH-DP and compare our results against sender -initiated CDMA protocols, i.e., MACA-CT =-=[13]-=-.

There are N nodes in the fully-connected networ H-DP is half the time spent in MACA-CT. Since no data will be ever sent with RICH-DP to a busy terminal, nodes in RICH-DP are immediately available to try again, something that is not the case in C-T =-=[15]-=-.

Hereaf -known topologies used in wireless ad hoc networks. Finally, we briefly conclude our paper in Section 5. 2. CENTRALIZED CONSTRUCTION Our algorithms borrow some ideas from the algorithm by Bose et al. =-=[5]-=- which constructs a bounded degree and planar spanner for a given points set V . They show that the length stretch factor (π+1)2π (3 cos π/6)(1+ɛ) of the final graph is and node degree is at most 27.  ently, the degree of each node u is bounded by 19 + ⌈ 2π α ⌉, when the structure is generated by above algorithm. For example, when α = π/3, the maximum node degree is at most 25. Method presented in =-=[5]-=- does not work for UDG(V ). THEOREM 2. Graph BPS1(UDG(V )) is a planar graph. PROOF. When each node u is being processed, we add two kinds of edges: (1) edge usi, where si is the nearest unprocessed n  of u in UDel(V ) from v ′ to v. Let v ′ = w1,w2, ··· ,wk = v be the sequence of neighbors of u in Del(V ) from v ′ to v. Obviously, the set {s1,s2,··· ,sl} is a subset of {w1,w2,··· ,wk}. Similar to =-=[5]-=-, consider the polygon P , formed by edge uw1, uwk and path w1w2 ···wk. We will show that the path w1w2 ···wk has length that is at most a small constant factor of the length ‖uv‖. Let us consider the","n wi and wj in the ordered neighborhood of u, which are added by processing u. For example, in Figure 2, D(w1,w7) = w1w2w3w4w5w6w7. We can bound the length of D(wi,wj) by π/2‖wiwj‖ by the argument in =-=[5, 6]-=-. In [6], it is shown that the length of D(wi,wj) is at most π/2 times ‖wiwj‖, provided that (1) the straight-line segment between wi and wj lies outside the Voronoi region induced by u, and (2) that","or wireless ad hoc networks has draw considerable attentions recently [11, 13, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 30].

Every node u collects the location information of N2(u) based on an efficient method =-=[8]-=- described later. It computes the Delaunay triangulation Del(N2(u)) of its 2-neighbors N2(u), including u itself. 2. For each edge uv of Del(N2(u)), let △uvw and △uvz be two triangles incident on uv.   uw to its set of incident edges if the triangle △uvw is in Del(N2(u)) and both v and w have sent either accept(u, v, w) or proposal(u, v, w). We now briefly review the communication efficient method =-=[8]-=- to collect N2(u) for every node u. Computing the set of 1-hop neighbors with O(n) messages is trivial: every node broadcasts a message announcing its ID. Computing the 2-hop neighborhood is not trivi g to the information about other nodes broadcast by the MIS nodes enables a node to compute its 2-hop neighborhood. The algorithm uses heavily the nodes in the connected dominating set, an example in =-=[8]-=- shows that overloading certain nodes might be unavoidable. The number of messages taken by this method is O(n), which is proved in [8] by using the properties of the specific connected dominating set roof of Case 1, it finishes our proof of spanner property of BPS2(UDG(V )). THEOREM 7. Algorithm 3 uses at most O(n) messages, where each message has O(log n) bits. PROOF.

If CSMA and ALOHA were to be used,  lar, protocols based on four-way handshakes of the form: request-to-send (CTS), clear-to-send (CTS), data, and MAC-level ACK can be improved. The four-way handshake common to protocols such as DFWMAC =-=[1]-=- is effective only in one-way traffic scenarios, in which the MAC-level ACK 17 can be used to also transfer a TULIP ACK (or the ACK for any other link-control protocol).

Unfortunately, although TCP works very well for wired networks with minimal losses other than those due to congestion, wired and wireless networks are significa t measured (a single packet was measured per window of outstanding data). The formula used was: R /\\Gamma ffR + (1 \\Gamma ff)M (1) where ff was typically equal to 0.9. Using this calculation, RFC 793 =-=[25]-=- recommended the retransmission timeout value (RTO) be set to RTO = Rfi (2) where fi is a delay variance factor with a recommended value of 2. In addition, this value was rounded up to expire with a 5","congestion window is as large as the bandwidth-delay product of the connection. Current versions of TCP react to losses differently and adjust the TCP congestion window in various ways. With the Reno =-=[26]-=- and Tahoe [17] versions the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments allows for the fast retransmission of a lost packet. Once the missing packet is retransmitted, however, Tahoe does not maintain  n the Internet. In 1988 the Tahoe version was implemented in 4.3 BSD Tahoe TCP [17]. It included slow start, congestion avoidance and fast retransmit. In 1990 Reno was implemented in 4.3 BSD Reno TCP =-=[26]-=-. Reno modified Tahoe by implementing fast retransmit followed by fast recovery. 2.1.1 TCP Tahoe Round-trip and Timeout Estimations Original TCP performed a simple round-trip time (RTT) estimate, whic re, if a segment is transmitted while the timer is in use, then a timeout is not recorded for that segment. Timing is done by incrementing a counter every 500-ms when the TCP timer routine is invoked =-=[26]-=-. When a timeout value is calculated, the corresponding segment sequence number is also recorded. When an ACK for this segment arrives, the timer is turned off. Each time there is a timeout for a segm  the other end. Slow start adds another window to the sender's TCP: the congestion window (cwnd), which is set equal to one segment when a connection is established or the slow start phase is entered =-=[26]-=- and never exceeds the receiver's advertised window. TCP uses a slow start threshhold (ssthresh) as a value to be used to determine if the slow start algorithm should be executed. Whenever an acknowle","nce number of a data packet received in sequence.

Hierarchical clustering in packet radio networks is motivated by the fact that the amount of information required to keep  the lowest-numbered identifier in that cluster elects itself as a new clusterhead. When a cluster becomes too small, the clusterhead resigns and the nodes join other clusters. Special mechanisms (see =-=[14]-=-) handle temporary disruptions in communications caused by cluster (re)formation. In packet radio networks, typically all of the nodes are switches.

Both employ a partitioning of the service area into location areas, and both are based on a two-level hierarchy. When a user subscribes to a PCS service provider, an entry is created in the Home Loc point's recent movement history, may then be used to predict the endpoint's next location. 4.1.1.

C.1 Terminodes Routing One approach that combines hierarchical and positionbased routing is part of the Terminodes project [BBC + 01]. In Terminodes routing a two-level hierarchy is proposed =-=[BGB00]-=-. Packets are routed according to a proactive distance vector scheme if the destination is close (in terms of hops) to the sending node. For long-distance routing a greedy position-based approach is u","hen packets are forwarded only towards the destination with positive progress.

Both are perform","e, reactive, and hybrid approaches. Proactive algorithms employ classical routing strategies such as distance-vector routing (e.g., DSDV [PB94]) or link-state routing (e.g., OLSR [JMQ + 01] and TBRPF =-=[BRT01]-=-). They maintain routing information about the available paths in the network even if these paths are not currently used. The main drawback of these approaches is that the maintenance of unused paths","asses: static ad-hoc networks and mobile ad-hoc networks. In static ad-hoc networks the position of a node may not change once it has become part of the network. Typical examples are rooftop networks =-=[BVGLA99]-=-.

Examples where mobile ad-hoc networks may be employed are the","ormation about the physical position of the participating nodes be available. Commonly, each node determines its own position through the use of GPS or some other type of positioning service [Kap96], =-=[CHH01]-=-, a survey of these methods can be found in [HB01]. A location service is used by the sender of a packet to determine the position of the destination and to include it in the packet's destination addr","currently used. The main drawback of these approaches is that the maintenance of unused paths may occupy a signi cant part of the available bandwidth if the topology of the network changes frequently =-=[DCY00]-=-. In response to this observation, reactive routing protocols were developed, for example DSR [JM96], TORA [PC97], and AODV [PR99]. Reactive routing protocols maintain only the routes that are current scussion of the current approaches, it is of great importance to investigate them also on a quantitative level. For non-positionbased approaches such evaluations have been performed in [BMJ + 98] and =-=[DCY00]-=- with very interesting results. It can be expected that a quantitative comparison will yield more information on the strengths and weaknesses of the individual approaches and on potential improvements","outing approaches. C.2 Grid Routing A second method for position-based ad-hoc routing containing hierarchical elements is proposed in the Grid [gri] project. The location proxy technique described in =-=[DM01]-=- is similar to Terminodes routing: a proactive distance vector routing protocol is used at the local level, while position based routing is employed for long-distance packet forwarding. In Grid routin according to the information of the proactive distance vector protocol. As a repair mechanism for the greedy long-distance routing a mechanism called Intermediate Node Forwarding (INF) is proposed in =-=[DM01-=-]. Like in Terminodes routing the idea is to perform position-based source routing. If a forwarding node has no neighbor with forward progress, it discards the packet and sends a notication to the sen","uires that all nodes store the information on some other nodes, it can be classied as an all-for-some approach. D. Homezone Two almost identical location services have been proposed independently in [=-=GH99]-=- and [Sto99a]. Both use the concept of a virtual Homezone where position information for a node is stored. The position C of the Homezone for a node can be derived by applying a well-known hash functi","s. Therefore the area covered by the ad-hoc network increases as the number of nodes increases. Since the expected distance of two uniformly sampled points within a square of size a  a scales with a [=-=Gho50]-=-, it is expected that the number of hops between two uniformly sampled participants increases proportional to the square-root of the increase in nodes. A. Location Services Table I shows the location","ribed is still at an early stage, it is an interesting idea worth of being studied further. C. Grid Location Service The Grid Location Service (GLS) [LJC + 00], [MJK + 00] is part of the Grid project =-=[gri]-=-. It divides the area that contains the ad-hoc network into a hierarchy of squares. In this hierarchy, n-order squares contain exactly four (n 1)- order squares, forming a so called quadtree. Each nod g-distance routing contains elements of reactive ad-hoc routing approaches. C.2 Grid Routing A second method for position-based ad-hoc routing containing hierarchical elements is proposed in the Grid =-=[gri]-=- project.

The routing decision at each node is then bas","reedy routing strategies MFR is a good strategy in scenarios where the sender of a packet cannot adapt the signal strength of the transmission to the distance between sender and receiver. However, in =-=[HL86-=-] it is shown that a dierent strategy performs better than MFR in situations where the sender can adapt its signal strength. In nearest with forward progress (NFP), the packet is transmitted to the ne packets, which cannot occur when packets are forwarded only towards the destination with positive progress. Other researchers proposed not to forward packets which have reached a local maximum at all =-=[HL86]-=-. The face-2 algorithm [BMSU99] and the perimeter routing strategy of the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing Protocol (GPSR) [Kar00], [KK00] are two very similar recovery approaches based on planar gr","otentially dierent subset. When these subsets are designed such that their intersection is non-empty, it is ensured that an up-to-date version of the sought-after information can always be found. In [=-=HL99]-=-, this scheme is used to develop a location service for ad-hoc networks. We will discuss it by means of the simple sample network shown in Figure 3. A subset of all mobile nodes is chosen to host posi ets, the higher the cost for position updates and queries, but also the larger the number of nodes in the intersection of two quorums, which improves resilience against unreachable backbone nodes. In =-=[HL99]-=- several methods on how to generate quorum systems with the desired properties are discussed. In the paper, the authors also show that the size of the quorum can be kept independent of the number of n ined in the backbone nodes is constant, since an individual backbone is formed for asxed number of nodes. None of thesesgures includes the management of the virtual backbone, which is not specied in [=-=HL99-=-]. The general robustness of the approach is medium, since the position of a node will become unavailable if a signicant number of backbone nodes fail. However, this number of nodes is a parameter tha","the topology of the network changes frequently. Finally, packets en route to the destination are likely to be lost if the route to the destination changes. Hybrid ad-hoc routing protocols such as ZRP =-=[HP01]-=- combine local proactive routing and global reactive routing in order to achieve a higher level of eciency and scalability. However, even a combination of both strategies still needs to maintain at le","upy a signi cant part of the available bandwidth if the topology of the network changes frequently [DCY00]. In response to this observation, reactive routing protocols were developed, for example DSR =-=[JM96]-=-, TORA [PC97], and AODV [PR99]. Reactive routing protocols maintain only the routes that are currently in use, thereby reducing the burden on the network when only a small subset of all available rout o be of medium complexity. The authors of GPSR have conducted a quantitative evaluation of the performance of their algorithms in a dynamic environment and compared it to Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) =-=[JM96]-=-.

Another strategy for forwarding packets is compass routing, which selects the neighbor closest to the straight line between sender and destination =-=[KSU99]-=-. In the example this would be node B.

Finally, it is possible to let the sender randomly choose one of the nodes closer t","neighbor in the required direction, a recovery procedure has to be started. This procedure is not part of the DREAM specication. B.2 Location Aided Routing (LAR) The Location Aided Routing proposal [=-=KV00-=-] does not dene a location-based routing protocol but instead proposes the use of position information to enhance the route discovery phase of reactive ad-hoc routing approaches. Reactive ad-hoc routi in LAR a request zone is dened as the set of nodes that should forward the route discovery packet. The request zone typically includes the expected zone. Two request zone types have been proposed in [=-=KV00-=-]: Thesrst type is a rectangular geographic region. In this case, nodes will forward the route discovery packet only if they are within that specic region. This type of request zone is shown in Figure","tables up-to date. As a further advantage positionbased routing supports the delivery of packets to all nodes in a given geographic region in a natural way. This type of service is called geocasting =-=[NI97]-=-. In this paper we present a survey of position-based routing for mobile ad-hoc networks. We outline the main problems that have to be solved for this class of routing protocols and we present the sol","nimize the spatial distance that a packet travels.

While DSR and AODV have consistently been shown to perform well under varied network characteristics [4], [5], =-=[9]-=-, the protocols share two fundamental traits that inherently bound their performance: (i) both protocols requiresooding of route requests, and (ii) they perform thesooding using broadcast relays which -loop detection mechanisms; and the aggressive caching policy is useful for limiting the number of nodes to which a route request propagates. However, DSR also suers from the following problems [5], [=-=9]-=-: First, DSRsoods route requests in the network using a series of local broadcasts. These local broadcasts which are transmitted as MAC broadcasts interfere with each other and with ongoing data trac, ting through to a wider area of the network. Furthermore, the caching cannot be made too aggressive since an overly aggressive caching policy can backre in the form of proliferated stale information [=-=9]-=-. In AODV, the problem is more pronounced because intermediate nodes can respond to a RREQ message only if they have an entry in their distance vector table for that particular destination, and a node age as in AODV. The propagation of RREQ messages using core broadcast proves to be benecial to AODV since a signicant portion of AODV's overhead stems from the propagation of its RREQ messages [4], [9]. We now elaborate on the bene ts AODVCEDAR enjoys when operating over the core infrastructure:  Lower Route Request Overhead: The propagation of RREQ messages over the core signicantly reduces the  run for a period of 450 seconds. Source-destination pairs were generated randomly andsows start randomly in the interval between 0 and 80 seconds.

Each node that receives the datum that is being broadcast will forward correspon ks, and 80% for one-to-all case, with performance very close to theoretically optimal one (which is the case when actual data are sent without previous meta-data). The power consumed by SPIN protocol =-=[HKB]-=- is (n-1)E + 2E' where n is number of nodes, e is the number of edges in the graph, and E and E' are mean powers consumed for sending long and 5 short messages along one hop, respectively.

On the other hand, file sharing is an example of a `long' message. In =-=[HKB]-=-, the concept of short and long messages was proposed. Each node will receive long message exactly once, which is optimal. Thus we will only try to optimize the number of short messages.

In other words, if any neighbor of v is also a neighbor of u, and v is co can be replaced by a path via u, thus node v is not needed as internal node. We may also say that node v is 'covered' by node u. The number of internal nodes can be further reduced by applying Rule 2 =-=[WL]-=-, as follows.

The concept of Group Allocation Multiple Access (GAMA) was first introduced by Muir and Garcia-Luna-Aceves =-=[12]-=- to provide performance guarantees in asynchronous MAC protocols. A GAMA protocol dynamically divides the channel into cycles of variable length; each cycle consists of a contention period and a group riod, the stations in the network reserve a space in the group-transmission period. To understand better how the contention protocol works in CARMA-NTG, consider how RTS collisions are solved in GAMA =-=[12]-=-. GAMA requires a station that wishes to send one or more packets to acquire the right to be part of the transmission group before transmitting the data packets. Stations follow a nonpersistent CSMA s","nsmission groups (CARMA-NTG). CARMA-NTG provides dynamic reservations of the channel, together with collision resolution of the reservations requests based on a treesplitting algorithm [8]. Like GAMA =-=[13]-=-, CARMA-NTG builds a dynamically-sized cycle that grows and shrinks depending upon traffic demand. Each cycle consists of a contention period and a group-transmission period during which one or more s r time periods equal to the propagation delays between senders of RTSs. During these periods, multiple stations may sense the channel free and also send RTSs, thus causing collisions. As specified in =-=[13]-=-, GAMA protocols solve collisions by backing off and rescheduling RTS transmissions.

QoS routing in wireless networks Wang and Crowcroft =-=[WC]-=- considered a number of issues in QoS routing for various architectures that support multimedia applications such as digital video and audio. They examined the basic problem of QoS routing, namely, fi  computation algorithms for source routing and hop-by-hop routing. Although loss probability, cost, and delay jitter are very useful parameters, delay and bandwidth are the two most important metrics =-=[WC]-=-. The bandwidth considered is the residual bandwidth available for new traffic. The bandwidth of a path is defined as the minimum of the residual bandwidth of all links on the path or the bottleneck b ay is determined by bottleneck bandwidth and traffic characteristics. Since queuing delay is already reflected in the bandwidth metric, we only need to consider propagation delay in the delay metrics =-=[WC]-=-. This way, one can make sure that the two metrics are not interdependent. Bottleneck bandwidth and propagation delay can be viewed as the width and length of a path. The problem of QoS routing is the","be called internal nodes for G (of course, a different definition for dominating set leads to different set of internal nodes). Routing based on a connected dominating set is frequently used approach =-=[WL]-=-, where the searching space for a route is reduced to corresponding internal nodes. The routing process, in this approach, is divided into three steps. If source node is not an internal node, it forwa he destination node. In the later case, the destination internal node forwards the packets directly to the destination node. Such routing is suggested for shortest path and for dynamic source routing =-=[WL]-=-, which do not use location information in routing decisions. Wu and Li [WL] proposed a simple and efficient distributed algorithm for calculating connected dominating set in ad hoc wireless networks.  Let us define inter-gateway nodes as nodes intermediate nodes that are not eliminated by Rule 1. Next, let the gateway nodes be those intermediate nodes that are not eliminated by both rules. Rule 1 =-=[WL]-=- is as follows. Consider two intermediate nodes v and u. If N[v]sN[u] in G and id(v)sthen node v is not an inter-gateway node. In other words, if any neighbor of v is also a neighbor of u, and v is co can be replaced by a path via u, thus node u is not needed as internal node. We may also say that node v is 'covered' by node u. The number of internal nodes can be further reduced by applying Rule 2 =-=[WL]-=-, as follows. Assume that, after applying Rule 1, u and w are two inter-gateway neighbors of a inter-gateway node v. If N(v)sN(u)sN(w) in G and id(v) = min {id(v), id(u), id(w)}, then node v is declar menovic and Wu [SSW] proposed to replace node ids with a record (degree, x, y), where degree is the number of neighbors of a node, and x and y are its two coordinates in the plane. In both rules from =-=[WL]-=-, nodes compare first their degrees, and node with higher degree has greater chances of remaining an internal node. In case of ties, x-coordinate is used to resolve.

In conclusion, we realized that additional techniques (beyond mere TCP) are necessary to obtain good performance in a multi-hop wireless environment. As previously indicated, one possible technique  e, initially introduced in Ethernet as an option, does in fact exist in MACAW as well as in the IEEE 802.3 standard. Thus, we proceeded to carry out a similar set of experiments as those described in =-=[2]-=-, this time with MACAW. We also increased the size of the networks under study and expanded the gamut of traffic types and patterns, in order to verify the validity of the results in more general envi t is substantially improved on multi-hop paths.

As we mentioned earlier, this is perceived as a serious th R by including a certificate of the base station in the first message. Apart from this feature it is identical to the basic MSR protocol, and therefore does not address the problem of replay. Carlsen =-=[7]-=- recognised this problem and suggested an `improved IMSR' protocol which includes a challenge-response mechanism to allow B to detect a session key replay.

We briefly mention two other prominent sets of protocols. 5.1 TMN Protocol One of the earliest suggested protocols for use in a mobile environment was that of Tatebayashi, Matsuzaki and Newman =-=[17]-=-, which has widely become known as the TMN protocol. In distinction to the protocols examined above, the TMN protocol takes place between two mobile stations M and M 0 who wish to exchange a session k","al power of the mobile and base station. For a general discussion on mobile security requirements, the reader is referred to the many sources detailed in the references, such as the article of Vedder =-=[18]-=-. The reader should beware that there are many different standards for mobile communications currently operating, and a great many more are planned for future implementation. The above threats may, th","ties in the repaired protocols it is worthwhile questioning whether the use of public key cryptography is justified in this case. 5.2 Varadharajan-Mu A set of protocols proposed by Vardharajan and Mu =-=[19, 20]-=- uses a basic architecture similar to that in the current standard protocols: mobile users share a secret with their home domain which is used to establish a session key whenever they roam into a diff","alidity while at the same time deleting B's identity from Cert(B).

In this paper we focus on flat topologies only, i.e., there is no aggregation of topology information into areas o work, moving over a flat space (5000m x 7000m), and initially randomly distributed at a density of one node per square kilometer. Nodes move in the simulation according to the &quot;random waypoint&qu=-=ot; model [10]-=-. Each node begins the simulation by remaining stationary for pause time seconds. It then selects a random destination and moves to that destination at a speed of 20 meters per second for a period of  , and TOB. 5.2.

INTRODUCTION The IEEE 802.11 standards =-=[4]-=- are widely used for wireless LAN (WLAN). They support two types of WLAN: one in infrastructure mode and the other in ad hoc mode. In the infrastructure mode, a station serves as the access point and  e place between the access point and the other members of the basic service set (BSS). When the infrastructure does not exist or does not work, the ad hoc mode is useful. In the IEEE 802.11 standards =-=[4], -=-an ad-hoc network is called an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS), in which all of the stations are within each other’s transmission range. Performance analysis of IEEE 802.11 WLAN has been report  of clock synchronization. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to report such a study. In an IEEE 802.11 WLAN, each station maintains a clock or timer. (A clock is called a timer in =-=[4]-=-; therefore, we use timer and clock interchangeably in this paper.) Clock synchronization is needed for power management, synchronization of frequency hopping, and coordination of Point Coordination F edy for the asynchronism problem. Section 7 concludes the paper. 2. CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION This section reviews the Timing Synchronization Function (TSF) as specified in the IEEE 802.11 specifications =-=[4]-=-, and comments on a few related clock synchronization algorithms. 2.1 The TSF of IEEE 802.11 MAC management plays an important role in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks. Synchronization functions and power","roposed a simple scheme to fix it. Our studies were based on the IEEE Std 802.11, 1999 Edition. An interesting question is whether the results reported here also apply to 802.11b LANs as specified in =-=[5]-=-. The answer is affirmative. First, clock synchronization is still an important requirement since the PHY layer of 802.11b still uses both DSSS and FHSS with power management. Second, our analyses in","f the timestamp is used for synchronization. This detail is not important for our analysis.s2.2 Related Work IEEE 802.11’s timing synchronization function is similar to the method proposed by Lampor=-=t [6]-=-.

Reference [2] evaluates the performance of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) of IEEE 802.11 standards and proposes an adaptive contention window protocol to replace the exponential backoff l. In [1] and [10], the saturation throughput of DCF is analyzed using different techniques. The effect of network size and traffic patterns on the capacity of ad hoc wireless networks is examined in =-=[7]-=-, where the locality of traffic is shown to be a key factor of scalability of ad hoc networks. All the above works are focused on the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. However, the scalability issue has not b","use its arrival time as a point of reference for comparing their clocks.

Routing protocols with various performance metrics The impact of performance metrics on a routing protocol is studied in =-=[41]-=-, where the link quality source routing (LQSR) is proposed on the basis of DSR. LQSR aims to select a routing path according to link quality metrics. Three performance metrics, i.e., the expected tran trics when nodes are mobile. The reason is that, as the sender moves, the ETX metric cannot quickly track the change in the link quality. This result illustrates that the link quality metrics used in =-=[41]-=- are still not enough for WMNs when mobility is concerned. Better performance metrics need to be developed, and routing protocols integrating multiple performance metrics are necessary for WMNs. 9.2.","Ns. 9.2. Multi-radio routing In WMNs, multi-radio per node may be a preferred architecture, because the capacity can be increased without modifying the MAC protocol. A routing protocol is proposed in =-=[42]-=- for multi-radio WMNs. A new performance metric, called the weighted cumulative expected transmission time (WCETT) is proposed for the routing protocol. WCETT takes into account both link quality metr ith good quality and channel diversity in the same routing protocol. In WMNs, multi-channel per radio is another alternative to improve the capacity. For this type of networks, the scheme proposed in =-=[42]-=- is not applicable because significant differences exist between a multi-channel node and a multi-radio node as explained in Section 8. 9.3.

An important implication is derived in [54] as a guideline to imp e capacity of ad hoc networks, however, it may still not be favored by many applications because wired connections between base stations do not exist in many ad hoc networks. The implication given in =-=[54]-=- can also be reflected in [130]. The scheme proposed in [130] increases the network capacity of ad hoc networks by utilizing the node mobility. When a node needs to send packets to another node, it wi y, a node only communicates with its nearby nodes. This scheme has a limitation: The transmission delay may become large and the required buffer for a node may be infinite. The analytical approach in =-=[54]-=- has significantly driven the progress in capacity research of ad hoc networks. However, it contains limitations. The networking protocols have not been fully captured by the analysis. For example, po p counts, link quality, etc. [41]. As a result, the applicability of the theoretical results on practical network architectures still remains unclear. A close match between the theoretical results in =-=[54]-=- and IEEE 802.11 based ad hoc networks is reported in [90].

To coordinate transmissions between network nodes under this situation, protocols such as the multi-channel MAC in =-=[122]-=- and the seed-slotted channel hopping (SSCH) scheme [14] are needed.

To illustrate typical issues existing in multichannel MAC protocols, here we explain two protocols in detail: multi-channel MAC (MMAC) =-=[122]-=- and multi-radio unification protocol (MUP) [3]. As far as MMAC is concerned, there are three main functions: • Maintaining data structure of all channels in each node. Channels of a node are classifi all nodes. • Selecting a channel. The criterion is to use a channel with the lowest count of source–destination pairs that have selected the channel. Several problems have not been solved in the MMAC =-=[122]-=-. • It is assumed that RTS/CTS always work in IEEE 802.11 DCF.

TCP variants The performance of classical TCPs degrades significantly irely new transport protocols As discussed before, many fundamental problems exist in TCP. Therefore, some researchers have started to develop entirely new transport protocols for ad hoc networks. In =-=[127]-=-, the ad hoc transport protocol (ATP) is proposed for ad hoc networks. Transmissions in ATP are rate-based, and quick start is used for initial rate estimation. The congestion detection is a delay-bas better performance (e.g., delay, throughput, and fairness) than the TCP variants.

RELATED PROTOCOLS AND SIMULATION PLATFORM 3.1 Random Early Detection (RED) The proposed NRED scheme is an extension of the RED =-=[6]-=- scheme developed for the wired Internet. RED is an active queue management scheme for congestion avoidance. It monitors the average queue size at each buffer. Once the average queue size exceeds a pr P connections in Figure 1 do not share any common node. However they still contend with each other for the medium. The implementation of RED used in our experiments follows the algorithm presented in =-=[6]-=-. The minimum and maximum queue size thresholds (minth and maxth) are set to 5 packets and 15 packets. The queue weight (e.g. wq) is 0.002. We vary the maximum drop probability maxp from 0.02 to 0.2.  ability pb based on the average queue size and broadcasts it to its neighbors.

The third problem is significant TCP unfairness which has been revealed and reported through both simulations and testbed measurements recently [17, 18, 19]. This paper focuses on the third problem, t of a 2-hop flow is only 1/2 of that of a 1-hop flow. Similarly, a 3-hop flow can only achieve at most 1/3. This feature is due to the spatial reuse constraint, which has been discussed in detail in =-=[7]-=- and [?]. The second factor is that interference is location dependent. Even two flows may contend with each other in a certain location, they are facing different interfering constraints from other l","unfairness and even flow starvation exists.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF NRED In this section, we further evaluate the proposed NRED scheme under more realistic scenarios such as considering multiple bottlenecks as well as mobility. The major nize the NCN packet, the unfairness can be improved to some degree. If we view TCP connections as general traffic flows, TCP fairness is essentially a multihop fair scheduling problem as discussed in =-=[12]-=-.

So far, no su ny specific factors have been identified as the triggers of TCP unfairness, such as: channel capture, hidden and exposed terminal conditions, and the binary exponential backoff of IEEE 802.11 MAC etc =-=[18, 19]-=-. Most of the factors can be traced back to the unfairness of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. However, the “greedy” behavior of TCP and its poor interaction with the MAC layer further exacerbate the unf ness over IEEE 802.11 MAC in ad hoc wireless networks.
