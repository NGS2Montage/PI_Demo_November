Modeling the RTT as a stochastic process, we analytically quantify and compare between the degree of degradation of the steadystate average throughput and window size due to spurious retransmissions for the different versions of TCP (Reno/NewReno versus Tahoe). The modeling methodology in this paper is used for evaluating different design alternatives for TCP for highly dynamic networks.",

To realize this expectation, a diverse set of challenges need to be addressed, which are posed by heterogeneous wireless networking environments within NGWI and the according application requirements. Furthermore, the architectural heterogeneities must be captured dynamically, while mobile users may roam during their connection duration. Current existing transport layer protocols have been developed for a specific network paradigm in mind, e.g., for wireless local area networks (WLANs), micro/macro wireless systems, or for satellite systems. Using these existing different transport layer protocols for NGWI to support global roaming of mobile users is not a practical solution due to processing and memory constraints of wireless terminals. Thus, there is a need",

            "ible with IEEE 802.11 standards in the sense of supporting both meshcapable and conventional Wi-Fi clients. Such WMNs also need to be inter-operable with other wireless networks such as WiMAX, ZigBee =-=[148]-=-, and cellular networks. Based on their characteristics, WMNs are generally considered as a type of ad-hoc networks due to the lack of wired infrastructure that exists in cellular or Wi-Fi networks th minism while assigning contentionbased, best-effort access periods. IEEE 802.15.4 is intended for telemetry with low data rate, long battery life and low device cost requirements. The ZigBee Alliance =-=[148]-=- is developing higher-level protocols that will run over 802.15.4 MAC and PHY layers that operate in unlicensed bands worldwide. Raw data rates of 250 Kbps can be achieved at 2.4 GHz (16 channels), 40"
