        "10.1.1.10.5015": "This paper presents the expected transmission count metric (ETX), which finds high-throughput paths on multi-hop wireless networks. ETX minimizes the expected total number of packet transmissions (including retransmissions) required to successfully deliver a packet to the ultimate destination. The ETX metric incorporates the effects of link loss ratios, asymmetry in the loss ratios between the two directions of each link, and interference among the successive links of a path. In contrast, the minimum hop-count metric chooses arbitrarily among the different paths of the same minimum length, regardless of the often large differences in throughput among those paths, and ignoring the possibility that a longer path might offer higher throughput.",
        "10.1.1.113.4100": "Abstract \u2014 As mobile ad hoc network applications are deployed, security emerges as a central requirement. In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a new, general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and thus defending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implements leashes. I.",
        "10.1.1.132.4609": "An ad hoc network is a group of wireless mobile computers (or nodes), in which individual nodes cooperate by forwarding packets for each other to allow nodes to communicate beyond direct wireless transmission range. Prior research in ad hoc networking has generally studied the routing problem in a non-adversarial setting, assuming a trusted environment. In this paper, we present attacks against routing in ad hoc networks, and we present the design and performance evaluation of a new secure on-demand ad hoc network routing protocol, called Ariadne. Ariadne prevents attackers or compromised nodes from tampering with uncompromised routes consisting of uncompromised nodes, and also prevents a large number of types of Denial-of-Service attacks. In addition, Ariadne is efficient, using only highly efficient symmetric cryptographic primitives.",
        "10.1.1.137.7197": "Ad hoc networks are completely wireless networks of mobile hosts, in which the topology rapidly changes due to the movement of mobile hosts. This frequent topology change may lead to sudden packet losses and delays. Transport protocols like TCP, which have been designed for reliable fixed networks, misinterpret this packet loss as congestion and invoke congestion control, leading to unnecessary retransmissions and loss of throughput. To overcome this problem, a feedback scheme is proposed so that the source can distinguish between a route failure and network congestion. When a route is disrupted, the source is sent a Route Failure Notification packet, allowing it to invalidate its timers and stop sending packets. When the route is reestablished, the source is informed through a Route Reestablishment Notification packet, upon which it resumes packet transmissions. Simulation experiments show that in the event of route failures, as the route reestablishment time increases, the use of feedback provides significant improvements in performance.",
        "10.1.1.21.7931": "The 802.11 standard for wireless networks includes a Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol, used to protect link-layer communications from eavesdropping and other attacks. We have discovered several serious security flaws in the protocol, stemming from misapplication of cryptographic primitives. The flaws lead to a number of practical attacks that demonstrate that WEP fails to achieve its security goals. In this paper, we discuss in detail each of the flaws, the underlying security principle violations, and the ensuing attacks.  1.",

AD HOC NETWORK ROUTING SECURITY In this section, we define a taxonomy of types of attackers and discuss specific attacks against ad hoc network routi od node, causing other good nodes to add that node to their blacklists, thus avoiding that node in routes. A more subtle type of routing disruption attack is the creation of a wormhole in the network =-=[21]-=-, using a pair of attacker nodes A and B linked via a private network connection. Every packet that A receives from the ad hoc network, A forwards through the wormhole to B, to then be rebroadcast by  cker is relatively easy. A network-wide shared secret key limits the attacker to replaying messages. Thus the main attacks remaining are the wormhole and rushing attacks (Section 5.2). Packet leashes =-=[21]-=- can prevent both attacks because they prevent an Active-0-x attacker from retransmitting packets. Most routing disruption attacks we present in Section 5.2 are caused by malicious injection or alteri e of the attackers. When replay protection and a global MAC key are used, an Active-0-x attacker (for x \u2265 1) can at most perform wormhole and rushing attacks. Packet leashes can prevent these attacks =-=[21]-=-.

If multiple antennas are in the transmitter and single antenna in the receiver, i.e., N =1, L =1 and either K >1or M > 1, antenna diversity or smart antenna cannot be applied unless the channel stat d. Otherwise, the advantages brought by such physical layer techniques will be significantly compromised. For directional and smart antennas, many MAC protocols have been proposed for ad hoc networks =-=[144,105,82,36]-=-. A MAC protocol for MIMO systems is studied in [126]. However, for multi-antenna systems, an efficient MAC protocol to achieve significant throughput improvement is still needed, as will be discussed",

Another type of attacks is packet forwarding, i.e., the attacker may not change routing tables, but the packets on the routing path may be lead to a different destinat d MAC protocols or to develop security monitoring and response systems to detect attacks, monitor service disruption, and respond quickly to attacks. To date, many secure protocols have been proposed =-=[60,145]-=-.
